       "[\"I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch. I am a former die-hard Fitbit user and I never, ever wanted an Apple Watch. My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price. Sure it had annoying quirks and short-comings, but it counted my steps, told me my heart rate every min of every day, and it tracked my sleep. Well, when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty.\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window. I HATED it. 1.5 days of battery life? Gross! And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face?!!? I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face. You know what? It doesn't work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long, collecting your info and doing who knows what with it?! You know what else? You are still getting steps in even if you can't see the count 24/7. Who knew?! I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving! My next battle came with my workouts. The first few days everything worked great (although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts). The total vs. active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed. After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts. I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering. I looked online and could find nothing about this issue, so I ended up calling Apple. PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phone's date settings to get more lives...DON'T. Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity. Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness. We did a hard reset and it all worked again. I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage. Apple should be ashamed. Fitbit blows them out of the water there, but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins. My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts? Nope! I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting and/or double counting my step and exercise calorie burn. I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active (not total) calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness. That being said, I've been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs. for well over a year, and now I know why. After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts I've dropped 1.5 lbs. I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals! And from there, my love for my Apple Watch bloomed.\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it. The sleep metrics are so bad that I really don't mind charging it while I sleep. The workout stats are great and I like that I don't have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running. I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch. I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit (don't judge). I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head. And most of all, I have learned to love the activity rings. I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day (tethered to my desk). More importantly, all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count!\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone, I want to be AWAY from my phone. I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality. If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user, I recommend you give it a go.\",\n",
       " 'I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct. The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles, but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you\\x92re the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something.',\n",
       " 'My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn\\'t make that one anymore. And it was getting flaky. So it was time for a new watch!\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don\\'t like a large clunky watch. This one is perfectly sized for me. I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work. Then setup of the watch also took quite a while. After setting it up, I wasn\\'t that impressed. Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch. That only lasted a day or two. Now I just love this thing.\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it. It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the \"complications\" on it I liked. Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face. Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app... And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that. It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night. And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up. Overall I like the implementation of it.\\n\\nChasing the rings - Hey, this was cool. I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods. 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said \"Hey, it looks like you\\'re working out\" and asked me what I was doing. It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors. I responded and continued my walk in the woods. At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details. I\\'m a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome. I also closed my green ring for the day. I like it.\\n\\nIt\\'s an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch. So far I like it a lot.\\n\\nDurability - ? My last watch lasted 7 years. Will this one? I don\\'t know. Only time can tell that. So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other.',\n",
       " 'I love apple products. I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s. This watch is really great. If you are interested in making health changes, and workout changes to improve overall fitness/health, this watch is for you. I have had Fitbit since 2009. I have been a loyal customer. I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I love this watch. The health breakdown is incredible. It is so detailed. It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about. For example walking stability or walking asymmetry? Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry? It links to the health app in the iPhone. In there everything is broken down. It has pushed me to exercise more. I am a video gamer. This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score. If you game, you know how addicting that challenge can be. I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch, and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit. The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life. The battery life is pretty bad. I have to charge it every day. Do not let that impact your decision to buy this. Since that is the only flaw I have found with the watch I give this product 5 stars. Also, beware that this does not come with the plug adapter. It comes with the charging cord. I guess Apple no longer includes the plugs with their products, they only include the cord. I am very happy with this purchase. I have retired my Fitbit completely. I was pretty sedentary until I purchased this watch. If you love Apple and you want to change your health/workout patterns, get this watch. There are so many cool apps to get to track other things you might want to track. I got this on prime day, so the price was a lower. Overall, the money you spend on this is well worth it. I got the GPS+Cellular. You do have to take the watch to your mobile carrier to set up the cellular. It is swim proof and water aerobic proof. As usual, Apple prevails. I also like that this is a super user friendly device as are all Apple products that I have ever used. If you want to track sleep, there are multiple apps to track it, so do not let that deter you from buying this. Also, Apple has great customer service. They are available online or on the phone 24/7. I hope everyone who buys this enjoys this as much as I do. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Apple!',\n",
       " 'Initially, my husband and I bought our Apple Watches from the Apple store 10 days before Amazon prime day (We had 4 days until the return window closes), so when I saw it\\x92s on sale for $120 less each, total of $260(tax included) I decided to return the ones we bought from Apple store and buy these ones on Amazon.\\nMy husband was adamant to buy it from Amazon, especially after reading all kinds of reviews about how people got empty boxes or bad watches.\\nEventually, we bought the watches and we are so glad we took the chance. We got everything that came with the watches, and there was no sign that the package has been messed with. The only complaint I have is that there is a little tear on the box; I keep all my Apple products boxes so I need all my boxes to look a certain way lol.\\nOverall, our watches are great! Charges super fast and battery life is great. Make sure to turn off \\x93always on Apple Watch face\\x94 to maximize the battery power.\\nNot saying the bad reviews are lies; but with Amazon and any other online stores, it\\x92s always a risk you\\x92re taking the moment you click add to cart and buy it now.\\nBuy it if it\\x92s on sale; return it, if it doesn\\x92t work for you.',\n",
       " 'I\\x92d wanted a Watch for years, then noticed Amazon offered the basic Series 7 GPS 41mm in green for $284 on Prime Day. I thought about it overnight while I did a bit of research.\\n\\nThe Series 7 has been out a while, but apparently the coming Series 8 will not see a major functional upgrade beyond outward design. It\\x92s expected to have the same battery, SoC and sensors, all packed in a flatter, rather, less-rounded case of similar size.\\n\\nMost users purchasing through Amazon report original equipment in new condition. Sure, there\\x92s always going to be an unfortunate few who receive a factory defective product, but at this price I was willing to risk the time and potential headache of exchange or refund. I purchased it without difficulty and received it within a few days. Upon unboxing, all packaging, components and accessories were pristine and in perfect working order.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I danced a happy little jig around my table as I realized, for once, things actually turned out in my favor.\\n\\nIn the last few weeks of wearing it each day, I appreciate its many capabilities. Though I do presume none are here to read how convenient a certain feature remains. Yet the main point I\\x92ll relay is the realistic expectation of a full day\\x92s battery life. I keep it on all day except for the ~20 minutes I set it down to charge each afternoon or evening depending on activities. I leave the screen always-on at max brightness and run various tracking, control, and communication apps continuously. Overall, it\\x92s helped to make life a little easier. These days, I\\x92ll take all the help I can get!',\n",
       " 'This is my fourth Apple watch. I\\x92ve purchased the series 0, series 1, 2, two series 4. One stainless, one aluminum. The 4 is such a great watch, I never felt the need to upgrade. I recently paid Apple $ 79 to replace my battery. They actually replaced the watch. I\\x92ve never had a problem with any Apple watch. I purchased the 7, because of a great Amazon price.\\n\\nStainless steel vs aluminum. Both are great. I put one bad scratch on my aluminum crystal. It doesn\\x92t affect function, and it only shows when the watch is dark. It happened when my watch hit the rough edge of our granite countertop. My SS has never scratched.\\n\\nWhy spend the extra money to get the stainless? If you want a GPS only model, the SS is $ 300 more than the aluminum. If you want cellular capability, the difference drops to $ 200. Due to health issues, my wife convinced me to get the cellular capability. In an emergency, these will call 911, even when your phone is not around, and even when you don\\x92t subscribe for service. That\\x92s important.\\n\\nThe series 7 has a blood oxygen measurement feature. During Covid, we purchased two different fingertip devices to measure blood oxygen. We were disappointed with both. The watch oxygen measurement works seamlessly. We consider it worth buying for that feature alone.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nIf you want cellular capability, spend the extra $ 200 for SS. If you don\\x92t, buy the aluminum model and save $ 300.\\nBoth are great watches.',\n",
       " \"The color is even more fab in person and the specs on this make my upgrade perfection! I've enjoyed putting the health app feature to it's max use FINALLY after all these years of wishing/wanting. It was easy to set everything up and the features work exactly as advertised making for a great start on keeping track of ALL the things I probably ought to but never had the opportunity beforehand! The battery life is great, I can get a full charge while I hop in the shower literally after wearing it much of the day & using it to the max with both navigation while driving & my health app as well as for my music/with my airpods for work. the battery hasn't run down on me yet & I've used it pretty heavily over the past week since it arrived. I even got a decent charge using the cord that came with my version 3 (I had to wait on a new plug to arrive so I could use the newer version which is even speedier than the older one! Moral of the story is either charging cord works great, the newer is just faster is all, but I didnt find the old one particularly slow by contrast which is great to know!) I just happily passed down my 3 to my daughter who was delighted to be able to finally have the meditation app for her anxiety & I haven't looked back since handing it off! My new watch is great, the battery lasts & charges speedily AND it has enough room to store all my apps that I want to use unlike my older watch that was constantly maxing out on the simplest of things/minimal use. I'm very happy with my upgrade!\",\n",

I have a old SE iPhone, My first step was to install os 15 wish I did with no issues. After that was done I paired my watch with no problem. I keep the face off and I can go 2 days with no charging and I really use it a lot. The alarm is a plus for me. Sound is super clear . I can go swimming with no worries and track my exercise. The oxygen is another plus for since I have asthma I can keep a track when I'm sick. I also recommend baying the insurance for a 2 year extended warranty. Is not expensive and its really worth it. for a 300hundred dollar watch.\",\n",

The screen is very large compared to older models. Personally, I wish the battery lasted a little longer. But, the battery does last me about 2 days with always on display turned off. Very easy to setup with the Watch app, not difficult at all.\\nI see so many reviews complaining about the USB-C connector as a charger. Almost all Apple products use USB-C on one end of the cable, and I don\\x92t understand why you would complain so much, as you should already have one, or go and buy one. Not a big deal.\\nAnother thing to mention, Apple doesn\\x92t use the \\x93plastic wrap\\x94 on some of their products, and the Apple Watch is one of them. Apple does it for environmental reasons. No one opened it, that is how Amazon and other stores receive them from apple. If something is wrong, Amazon will help you, don\\x92t complain on a review before asking Amazon for help.\\nOverall great watch, and it was at a great price when purchased.

I am not disappointed in any way. It is simply a fantastic device. The fit and finish are beautiful and the functionality is excellent.\\n\\nTwo other points that I'd suggest a potential buyer keep in mind:\\n- There is a ton of functionality here and it takes a while to learn. Don't be like me and just skip the tutorials. They contain good information that will allow a new user to get up to speed more quickly.\\n- I may get a different wristband. The one that comes with my watch tends to pinch my wrist when I exercise and I find myself being distracted by it. I'm not saying that there is a better option, because I haven't found one yet.

It did take longer than stated to charge, but now seems to be working ok. My biggest need is to track my heart rate, and that is working, so far. The battery does not last anywhere near as long as my Fitbit and it does need charging before bed in order to track sleep, which was another conundrum as it didn\\x92t ask during sleep set up as it should have. It did not track sleep the first night (despite being set up to do so in the app on my phone), so I reset it hoping set up would ask (it did not). It ultimately did track on night 2.\\nOtherwise, the green on the band is a little brighter than army green, which is nice and the actual watch is more black than green which will enable easier band swapping.\\nAfter using a Fitbit for years, it will take some getting used to, but I am hoping the increased functionality and Apple will give more reliability than the Fitbit (which each I had ended up with a warranty replacement in the first year).',\n",

Unfortunately, since I did not purchase the watch directly from Apple, I needed to go through the Amazon return process. Apple would service the watch but not exchange it. The return through Amazon required more steps than a regular return, but it worked, and I got my money back.

There are so many faces to choose from too. My husband bought me a Tag Heuer for our 20th anniversary 15 years ago. I am I watch person I like to switch watches to go with my outfit or how I am feeling that day. With a Tag and that price tag you kind of feel like you have to wear it every day. With my Apple Watch and it\\x92s ability to modify in so many different ways I feel like I\\x92m wearing a different one every day. I still have my Tag but now only wear it for special occasions.',\n",

The band has a nice soft feel to it and sometimes it doesn't feel like I am wearing a watch.\\nThe health apps do have some disclaimers so I don't read to much into it. For me I call it for entertaining purposes. My opinion is the results must me somewhere in the ballpark.\\nI have used the sleep app that came with the watch but only allows you to set an alarm. I already know I'm a poor sleeper I don't think I need an app to tell me that.\\nI ride my bike and there is a cool feature that detects that your riding a bike and records the miles,speed and calories. I do workout at the gym, but it doesn't record the machine I'm using or calories I have burned. Will need to investigate. I have had the watch for nearly a month, and I highly recommend it.\",\n",

It was delivered the day after I placed the order, the brick 2 days later. I also ordered the hard screen protector ( set of 2). I was able to set it up fairly easily, I have had it now for 3 days and have tried several of the features. So far, the one con is trying to respond to a text on the Watch. The keyboard is predictive and if you try to X out what you type, it\\x92s right under the Send. So my texts have been incomplete with typos. Fat finger syndrome! I changed the size of the text to help me see what I entered which helped a bit. I\\x92m left handed so the Watch is on my left wrist. Typing with the right hand is not the easiest for me, so will be working on improving my right handed typing or using the dictation more often. So far, am glad to have bit the bullet.

In fact, I have not worn any type of watch for decades. I must say, for me, I am extremely glad I went with the Apple 45mm. I have only had it a few days. One of the things that impresses me the most is it is not nearly as \"heavy\" as I had read. The Always On feature makes it so easy to quickly see the time and the curved design allows one to read the time at all angles. For the Face, I choose Photos in which you can choose up to 24 photos. The clarity of these is beyond expectation. Colors are true to reality; not dimmed; not fuzzy.; not distorted. Absolutely a treasure. As I have been a medical transcriptionist for 25-years (and counting), having the watch encourage me to Stand is a plus. Also, having the ability to run an EKG and check blood oxygen level are additional pluses. Would I get another Apple Watch? By all means, yes. Will I get different bands? Yes.

The battery was depleting very quickly due to all the apps and features. I had to decide which ones were important or useful for me, and turn off the rest.

I can understand not providing a regular USB block - I have multiple ways to charge USB, in fact many public facilities provide such access. USB-C is NOT widespread yet, so it\\'s an added expense to purchase one.

It\\x92s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can\\x92t remember where are you left it. The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like. If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen. This happens when you place to watch on your wrist in the morning or remove it during the day. The battery life is just OK. It only charges from an Apple proprietary charger \\x96 \\x96 it charges quickly but the battery only lasts a day or two \\x96 \\x96 much shorter than the Fitbit life. The battery charging cords are not cheap. There is one included in the box. You are probably going to need to purchase a second one. The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter, which is also an expense. I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well. You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse.

Long story short, I had a cardio version and was put on a beta blocker which worked well for about 6 days. Then my heart would kick back into AFIB for a little while, then the beta blocker would try to convert back to sinus rythym, in doing so, my heart would do what they call 'conversion pauses', only mine would pause to the point of nearly passing out. I happened to catch one of the worst pauses that lasted 8.7 seconds. I was using my Apple Watch in the ECG mode to check AFIB, at the time. My heart was pausing multiple times. Sent the recordings to my heart dr. and he took me off the beta blocker for now. I will go back on those after I get my pacemaker the end of the month. If it had not been for the watch and the ability to do the ECGs, I would have not known what was going on and would have thought it to be common under the circumstances. So, I think the watch may have saved my life, by helping to figure out the pauses, which kept getting worse. Thanks to Apple, I'm still here to write about it. Sure something else may have worked just as well, but this is what worked for me. It saved me having to wear a monitor for weeks at the very least.\",\n",

       " \"I got this watch as a B-day present for my wife. The primary reason was fitness tracking and mostly for the heart rate feature when she's on her bike. The screen is big and easy for her to see at a glance. The set up seemed to be easy even for her as she is not tech savvy. Can't figure out the sleep tracker however. Overall, I think she likes it or she acts like she likes it.\\nCons: It AIN'T CHEAP. Battery life is short. She opened it to discover the power cord was missing which means that it had previously been opened. That was a hassle trying to figure out what to do. Talked to Amazon about it and they offered me $40 to go drive all over creation and find a way to charge it. The wrist band provided is quite literally, a joke. Order a cheap-o one piece when you order the watch. The problem is that it very easily pops open and the watch falls to the ground just like that, a dozen times a day and sometimes you don't realize it has come off. So that makes it super easy to lose. Really really stupid and poor design and they should be ashamed. Then......what we ordered was the Apple Series 7 (GPS) Brand new not reconditioned. What we got was the Apple Series 7 (GPS and Cellular) which is a much more expensive watch but we got it for the GPS only price. So again that confirms that the packaging was opened up and things were removed and switched OR it means that we got a reconditioned watch. THAT would really piss me off but I can't confirm it. All it all, it is decent, she likes it and we are moving forward with life. ~Patrick J, Fruita, Colorado\",\n",

Some folks have claimed it's inaccurate, but it's correct the way I use it, which I will explain here. Please note: I've compared it to my oximeter which is absolutely accurate compared to one of the world's largest hospitals oxygen reporting machines, and it's inline with both.\\n\\nAt sleep my oxygen goes down, so it's accuracy is imperative to me.

Beautiful. The faces are wonderful.\\n\\nThe price dropped dramatically and I nearly sent it back. I didn't because I love the watch.

I have to charge it once a day.\\n\\nThe speaker and mic are okay. They work, although I feel funny talking into my watch. Futuristic in a retro way.\\n\\nThe band it comes with did not work for me at all. It has two sizes, but it appears flimsy and keeps falling off. On the plus side it fell many times, and I nearly returned it for that, but it did not break, so I did not. Watch bands are plentiful and all are better than the OEM.\\n\\nDoes not take blood pressure, as far as I can tell. That's about all it doesn't do.\\n\\nI'm not yet certain about subscribing to the apple watch thing. I have a 3 month trial period before I will decide. So far I haven't needed that aspect of it. I suppose if I were to work out on my own it would be very good.\\n\\nGreat watch -- beautiful, appears to be water proof. Strong. Great display. So long as it lasts I'm very happy.

So I\\x92ll be riding and then blow my eardrums out because it scrolls to max volume. I haven\\x92t figured out a way to turn it off, if there is one.

I loved everything about Fitbit, from the simplistic ease of use to the excellent stats it kept to the battery life (about a week usually).\\n\\nI had the Ionic, which was recently recalled. I never had an issue with it, but I\\x92d had it for almost 3 years and thought, if they\\x92re going to refund me what I paid 3 years ago, I might as well try an Apple Watch. All in all I spent less than $100 for the 45mm Series 7.\\n\\nFirst impressions: I hated it. It\\x92s got waaaaay more functionality than a Fitbit, and that\\x92s not necessarily a good thing. It\\x92s too much if you\\x92re looking for a step counter, sleep/heart rate/activity monitor. Fitbit uses ONE app to easily display all the pertinent info you need. Apple Watch uses no fewer than THREE different apps - Fitness, Watch and Health - to monitor info and/or change watch displays. You can also download more apps to monitor things such as sleep. It\\x92s not complicated, but it\\x92s overly complicated and cumbersome. Apple should seriously consider hiring some people away from Fitbit and take some advice. Oh, and the battery life is absolute trash compared to Fitbit. I have to charge it every 24-36 hours, depending on usage. The good thing is that it does charge super fast, but I guess it probably should, considering the capacity is so awful.\\n\\nIt\\x92s basically an iPhone shrunk down to wear on your wrist. It has some interesting functionality such as making/receiving calls, and you can send texts from it, although the screen and keyboard are so small, it\\x92s best to use the pre-canned responses rather than try to type out an actual message.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but I\\x92ll try to sum it up. If you\\x92re a long-time Fitbit user, keep using Fitbit unless you just want to try something new. But beware. Even after two weeks of the Apple Watch I was considering sending it back, but I\\x92m sticking it out. When it dies, I\\x92ll probably go back to Fitbit unless they\\x92re out of business or Apple makes some much needed changes to streamline it and improve the battery life.\\n\\nHighly overrated.',\n",

The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof, durable, and has great utility. The AP7 does it all. I'm also getting older, and I want to keep track of my health. I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health.\\n\\nThe AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture. I'm able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does, in some form, interrupt my productivity. The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.\\n\\nIt is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro, and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates.\\n\\nHowever, my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life. It doesn't bother me so much, but I have to charge it every night.\\n\\nIt looks amazing, has professional and luxury vibes, and is pretty customizable. There are non-OEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking.\\n\\nOverall, I am pretty happy with it!

It\\'s better than some others, but doesn\\'t hold a candle to the Bip, which was somehow reflective in bright light, sort of like a Kindle.\\n3. The sleep tracking is ok, about what you\\'d expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn\\'t very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.\\n4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.\\n5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn\\'t get in the way at all.\\n6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.\\n7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.\\n\\nIt has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it\\'s unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.',\n",

There are other smartwatches that beat the Apple Watch big time on battery, so it makes you wonder what does Apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days.\\n\\nAside from the battery, which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour (The charging is super fast now), there's nothing else to complain about.

After all, my trusty Series 4 had many of the same features (delivering notifications silently on my wrist, sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and an EKG party-trick ability that I rarely use but is cool to have I guess) and was more than adequate enough for my use case. However, my Series 4's battery life was waning, and I was itching to move on from a rose gold watch, so when I saw that the price of this particular Series 7 variation dropped to $379, I knew I could afford to pull the trigger. Compared to my Series 4, this watch has many iterative improvements, including an always-on display, slightly larger screen, and a blood oxygen sensor, that when taken as a whole, make me a happy customer. The midnight color is definitely better-looking in person as well! If you're an existing Apple Watch user and have an older model, then this is an upgrade worth considering. If you're looking to get into the smartwatch world and have an iPhone, then this could be a good starter smartwatch for you.\",\n",

Updating to 15.1 took an hour!\\n\\nNext when I tried to pair the watch, the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch. I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB \"C\" charger which is not included with the watch. Do you have such a charger? I didn\\'t even know such chargers existed. I have ten chargers, including several made by apple, and they all only accept the original USB plug, called USB \"A\".\\n\\nI recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers.

       "[\"I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch. I am a former die-hard Fitbit user and I never, ever wanted an Apple Watch. My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price. Sure it had annoying quirks and short-comings, but it counted my steps, told me my heart rate every min of every day, and it tracked my sleep. Well, when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty.\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window. I HATED it. 1.5 days of battery life? Gross! And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face?!!? I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face. You know what? It doesn't work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long, collecting your info and doing who knows what with it?! You know what else? You are still getting steps in even if you can't see the count 24/7. Who knew?! I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving! My next battle came with my workouts. The first few days everything worked great (although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts). The total vs. active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed. After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts. I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering. I looked online and could find nothing about this issue, so I ended up calling Apple. PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phone's date settings to get more lives...DON'T. Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity. Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness. We did a hard reset and it all worked again. I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage. Apple should be ashamed. Fitbit blows them out of the water there, but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins. My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts? Nope! I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting and/or double counting my step and exercise calorie burn. I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active (not total) calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness. That being said, I've been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs. for well over a year, and now I know why. After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts I've dropped 1.5 lbs. I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals! And from there, my love for my Apple Watch bloomed.\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it. The sleep metrics are so bad that I really don't mind charging it while I sleep. The workout stats are great and I like that I don't have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running. I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch. I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit (don't judge). I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head. And most of all, I have learned to love the activity rings. I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day (tethered to my desk). More importantly, all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count!\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone, I want to be AWAY from my phone. I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality. If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user, I recommend you give it a go.\",\n",
       " 'I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct. The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles, but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you\\x92re the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something.',\n",
       " 'My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn\\'t make that one anymore. And it was getting flaky. So it was time for a new watch!\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don\\'t like a large clunky watch. This one is perfectly sized for me. I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work. Then setup of the watch also took quite a while. After setting it up, I wasn\\'t that impressed. Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch. That only lasted a day or two. Now I just love this thing.\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it. It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the \"complications\" on it I liked. Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face. Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app... And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that. It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night. And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up. Overall I like the implementation of it.\\n\\nChasing the rings - Hey, this was cool. I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods. 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said \"Hey, it looks like you\\'re working out\" and asked me what I was doing. It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors. I responded and continued my walk in the woods. At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details. I\\'m a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome. I also closed my green ring for the day. I like it.\\n\\nIt\\'s an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch. So far I like it a lot.\\n\\nDurability - ? My last watch lasted 7 years. Will this one? I don\\'t know. Only time can tell that. So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other.',\n",
       " 'I love apple products. I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s. This watch is really great. If you are interested in making health changes, and workout changes to improve overall fitness/health, this watch is for you. I have had Fitbit since 2009. I have been a loyal customer. I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I love this watch. The health breakdown is incredible. It is so detailed. It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about. For example walking stability or walking asymmetry? Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry? It links to the health app in the iPhone. In there everything is broken down. It has pushed me to exercise more. I am a video gamer. This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score. If you game, you know how addicting that challenge can be. I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch, and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit. The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life. The battery life is pretty bad. I have to charge it every day. Do not let that impact your decision to buy this. Since that is the only flaw I have found with the watch I give this product 5 stars. Also, beware that this does not come with the plug adapter. It comes with the charging cord. I guess Apple no longer includes the plugs with their products, they only include the cord. I am very happy with this purchase. I have retired my Fitbit completely. I was pretty sedentary until I purchased this watch. If you love Apple and you want to change your health/workout patterns, get this watch. There are so many cool apps to get to track other things you might want to track. I got this on prime day, so the price was a lower. Overall, the money you spend on this is well worth it. I got the GPS+Cellular. You do have to take the watch to your mobile carrier to set up the cellular. It is swim proof and water aerobic proof. As usual, Apple prevails. I also like that this is a super user friendly device as are all Apple products that I have ever used. If you want to track sleep, there are multiple apps to track it, so do not let that deter you from buying this. Also, Apple has great customer service. They are available online or on the phone 24/7. I hope everyone who buys this enjoys this as much as I do. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Apple!',\n",

       " 'This is my fourth Apple watch. I\\x92ve purchased the series 0, series 1, 2, two series 4. One stainless, one aluminum. The 4 is such a great watch, I never felt the need to upgrade. I recently paid Apple $ 79 to replace my battery. They actually replaced the watch. I\\x92ve never had a problem with any Apple watch. I purchased the 7, because of a great Amazon price.\\n\\nStainless steel vs aluminum. Both are great. I put one bad scratch on my aluminum crystal. It doesn\\x92t affect function, and it only shows when the watch is dark. It happened when my watch hit the rough edge of our granite countertop. My SS has never scratched.\\n\\nWhy spend the extra money to get the stainless? If you want a GPS only model, the SS is $ 300 more than the aluminum. If you want cellular capability, the difference drops to $ 200. Due to health issues, my wife convinced me to get the cellular capability. In an emergency, these will call 911, even when your phone is not around, and even when you don\\x92t subscribe for service. That\\x92s important.\\n\\nThe series 7 has a blood oxygen measurement feature. During Covid, we purchased two different fingertip devices to measure blood oxygen. We were disappointed with both. The watch oxygen measurement works seamlessly. We consider it worth buying for that feature alone.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nIf you want cellular capability, spend the extra $ 200 for SS. If you don\\x92t, buy the aluminum model and save $ 300.\\nBoth are great watches.',\n",

I even got a decent charge using the cord that came with my version 3 (I had to wait on a new plug to arrive so I could use the newer version which is even speedier than the older one! Moral of the story is either charging cord works great, the newer is just faster is all, but I didnt find the old one particularly slow by contrast which is great to know!) I just happily passed down my 3 to my daughter who was delighted to be able to finally have the meditation app for her anxiety & I haven't looked back since handing it off!

I keep the face off and I can go 2 days with no charging and I really use it a lot. The alarm is a plus for me. Sound is super clear . I can go swimming with no worries and track my exercise. The oxygen is another plus for since I have asthma I can keep a track when I'm sick. I also recommend baying the insurance for a 2 year extended warranty.

Very easy to setup with the Watch app, not difficult at all.\\nI see so many reviews complaining about the USB-C connector as a charger. Almost all Apple products use USB-C on one end of the cable, and I don\\x92t understand why you would complain so much, as you should already have one, or go and buy one. Not a big deal.\\nAnother thing to mention, Apple doesn\\x92t use the \\x93plastic wrap\\x94 on some of their products, and the Apple Watch is one of them. Apple does it for environmental reasons.

The return through Amazon required more steps than a regular return, but it worked, and I got my money back. It was just a little disappointing to have to wait another week before being able to make the exchange. Once my money was refunded, I went to Apple and purchased another watch. In the future I will purchase Apple products directly from the store to save the extra steps if there is a problem.',\n",
       " 'I reserved buying an AppleWatch as I had always used FitBits and my main goal for a while was steps and weight loss. I still think if you want a pure pedometer fitbit is better, but not by too much. The computability with my iPhone makes it an amazing device were I wish I had gotten an Apple Watch a lot sooner. I most recently went with a fitbit sense and my wife has a Versa. We both had connectivity issues and always needed to have the fitbit app open to be able to sync to the phone. This applewatch is always synced which makes it smoother. Apps extend to the watch and the battery charges fast.

This watch gives you a-lot of apps that allows you to work alongside your iPhone. It is fun to use and nice to look at. Although there are a lot of great things this watch provides I personally believe that there could of been a lot more incorporated in this generation of watch to make it better. The battery life is alright I\\x92d give it. A 4/10 it requires a lot of charging if you put it to use, which is understandable, just a bit frustrating. The big one is nice if you have a large arm, wrist, and fingers. The buttons are tiny so they have added a microphone, so you can talk into for it either for phone calls or voice chat to text instead of typing. If you have the money or want one I\\x92d say why not? The more popular they get the, better they be sooner, at least I\\x92d like to hope.

I already know I'm a poor sleeper I don't think I need an app to tell me that.\\nI ride my bike and there is a cool feature that detects that your riding a bike and records the miles,speed and calories.

It was delivered the day after I placed the order, the brick 2 days later. I also ordered the hard screen protector ( set of 2).

One of the things that impresses me the most is it is not nearly as \"heavy\" as I had read. The Always On feature makes it so easy to quickly see the time and the curved design allows one to read the time at all angles. For the Face, I choose Photos in which you can choose up to 24 photos. The clarity of these is beyond expectation. Colors are true to reality; not dimmed; not fuzzy.; not distorted. Absolutely a treasure. As I have been a medical transcriptionist for 25-years (and counting), having the watch encourage me to Stand is a plus.

I can understand not providing a regular USB block - I have multiple ways to charge USB, in fact many public facilities provide such access. USB-C is NOT widespread yet, so it\\'s an added expense to purchase one.

It\\x92s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can\\x92t remember where are you left it. The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like. If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen.

The battery charging cords are not cheap. There is one included in the box. You are probably going to need to purchase a second one. The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter, which is also an expense. I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well. You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse.

       " \"I have been thinking about the Apple Watch for quite a while, had a colonoscopy a year ago and learned that my AFIB had returned. Long story short, I had a cardio version and was put on a beta blocker which worked well for about 6 days. Then my heart would kick back into AFIB for a little while, then the beta blocker would try to convert back to sinus rythym, in doing so, my heart would do what they call 'conversion pauses', only mine would pause to the point of nearly passing out. I happened to catch one of the worst pauses that lasted 8.7 seconds. I was using my Apple Watch in the ECG mode to check AFIB, at the time. My heart was pausing multiple times. Sent the recordings to my heart dr. and he took me off the beta blocker for now. I will go back on those after I get my pacemaker the end of the month. If it had not been for the watch and the ability to do the ECGs, I would have not known what was going on and would have thought it to be common under the circumstances. So, I think the watch may have saved my life, by helping to figure out the pauses, which kept getting worse. Thanks to Apple, I'm still here to write about it. Sure something else may have worked just as well, but this is what worked for me. It saved me having to wear a monitor for weeks at the very least.\",\n",

Overall, I think she likes it or she acts like she likes it.\\nCons: It AIN'T CHEAP. Battery life is short. She opened it to discover the power cord was missing which means that it had previously been opened. That was a hassle trying to figure out what to do. Talked to Amazon about it and they offered me $40 to go drive all over creation and find a way to charge it. The wrist band provided is quite literally, a joke. Order a cheap-o one piece when you order the watch. The problem is that it very easily pops open and the watch falls to the ground just like that, a dozen times a day and sometimes you don't realize it has come off. So that makes it super easy to lose. Really really stupid and poor design and they should be ashamed. Then......what we ordered was the Apple Series 7 (GPS) Brand new not reconditioned. What we got was the Apple Series 7 (GPS and Cellular) which is a much more expensive watch but we got it for the GPS only price. So again that confirms that the packaging was opened up and things were removed and switched OR it means that we got a reconditioned watch. THAT would really piss me off but I can't confirm it.

It\\'s unacceptable IMO for a smartwatch that retails over $400 (which the 45 does). If I ever get another Apple Watch, it will 100% be on the higher end casings that actually have sapphire glass. Friends have stainless steel and their watches are 100% scratch free after a year while my aluminum model is already scuffed and looks second hand after 2 months. In marketing and descriptions from Apple it reads like all models have the sapphire glass unless you read the fine print, this is just a PSA for those considering the aluminum.\\n\\nAs for the Apple Watch on its own merits, I love it. The sleep tracking is basically non-existent and the battery needs to be charged every day, but the other functions and the user experience are spectacular.

All in all I spent less than $100 for the 45mm Series 7.\\n\\nFirst impressions: I hated it. It\\x92s got waaaaay more functionality than a Fitbit, and that\\x92s not necessarily a good thing. It\\x92s too much if you\\x92re looking for a step counter, sleep/heart rate/activity monitor. Fitbit uses ONE app to easily display all the pertinent info you need. Apple Watch uses no fewer than THREE different apps - Fitness, Watch and Health - to monitor info and/or change watch displays. You can also download more apps to monitor things such as sleep. It\\x92s not complicated, but it\\x92s overly complicated and cumbersome. Apple should seriously consider hiring some people away from Fitbit and take some advice. Oh, and the battery life is absolute trash compared to Fitbit. I have to charge it every 24-36 hours, depending on usage. The good thing is that it does charge super fast, but I guess it probably should, considering the capacity is so awful.\\n\\nIt\\x92s basically an iPhone shrunk down to wear on your wrist. It has some interesting functionality such as making/receiving calls, and you can send texts from it, although the screen and keyboard are so small, it\\x92s best to use the pre-canned responses rather than try to type out an actual message.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but I\\x92ll try to sum it up. If you\\x92re a long-time Fitbit user, keep using Fitbit unless you just want to try something new. But beware. Even after two weeks of the Apple Watch I was considering sending it back, but I\\x92m sticking it out. When it dies, I\\x92ll probably go back to Fitbit unless they\\x92re out of business or Apple makes some much needed changes to streamline it and improve the battery life.\\n\\nHighly overrated.',\n",

The reaction time with using the screen, crown, or button is instant. No lag at all.\\n\\nThe only issue I have is the battery. I never went to Apple Watch before Series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere I got is just untenable.\\n\\nSeries 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours.

The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof, durable, and has great utility. The AP7 does it all. I'm also getting older, and I want to keep track of my health. I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health.\\n\\nThe AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture. I'm able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does, in some form, interrupt my productivity. The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.\\n\\nIt is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro, and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates.\\n\\nHowever, my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life. It doesn't bother me so much, but I have to charge it every night.\\n\\nIt looks amazing, has professional and luxury vibes, and is pretty customizable. There are non-OEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking.\\n\\nOverall, I am pretty happy with it!

The sleep tracking is ok, about what you\\'d expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn\\'t very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.\\n4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.\\n5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn\\'t get in the way at all.\\n6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.\\n7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.\\n\\nIt has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun.

The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it\\'s unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.',\n",

However, my Series 4's battery life was waning, and I was itching to move on from a rose gold watch, so when I saw that the price of this particular Series 7 variation dropped to $379, I knew I could afford to pull the trigger.

Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I've worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I've had my watch, I've found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone.

       "'I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch. I am a former die-hard Fitbit user and I never, ever wanted an Apple Watch. My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price. Sure it had annoying quirks and short-comings, but it counted my steps, told me my heart rate every min of every day, and it tracked my sleep. Well, when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty.\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window. I HATED it. 1.5 days of battery life? Gross! And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face?!!? I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face. You know what? It doesn\\'t work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long, collecting your info and doing who knows what with it?! You know what else? You are still getting steps in even if you can\\'t see the count 24/7. Who knew?! I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving! My next battle came with my workouts. The first few days everything worked great (although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts). The total vs. active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed. After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts. I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering. I looked online and could find nothing about this issue, so I ended up calling Apple. PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phone\\'s date settings to get more lives...DON\\'T. Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity. Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness. We did a hard reset and it all worked again. I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage. Apple should be ashamed. Fitbit blows them out of the water there, but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins. My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts? Nope! I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting and/or double counting my step and exercise calorie burn. I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active (not total) calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness. That being said, I\\'ve been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs. for well over a year, and now I know why. After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts I\\'ve dropped 1.5 lbs. I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals! And from there, my love for my Apple Watch bloomed.\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it. The sleep metrics are so bad that I really don\\'t mind charging it while I sleep. The workout stats are great and I like that I don\\'t have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running. I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch. I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit (don\\'t judge). I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head. And most of all, I have learned to love the activity rings. I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day (tethered to my desk). More importantly, all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count!\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone, I want to be AWAY from my phone. I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality. If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user, I recommend you give it a go. I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct. The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles, but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you\\x92re the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something. My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn\\'t make that one anymore. And it was getting flaky. So it was time for a new watch!\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don\\'t like a large clunky watch. This one is perfectly sized for me. I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work. Then setup of the watch also took quite a while. After setting it up, I wasn\\'t that impressed. Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch. That only lasted a day or two. Now I just love this thing.\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it. It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the \"complications\" on it I liked. Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face. Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app... And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that. It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night. And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up. Overall I like the implementation of it.\\n\\nChasing the rings - Hey, this was cool. I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods. 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said \"Hey, it looks like you\\'re working out\" and asked me what I was doing. It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors. I responded and continued my walk in the woods. At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details. I\\'m a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome. I also closed my green ring for the day. I like it.\\n\\nIt\\'s an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch. So far I like it a lot.\\n\\nDurability - ? My last watch lasted 7 years. Will this one? I don\\'t know. Only time can tell that. So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other. I love apple products. I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s. This watch is really great. If you are interested in making health changes, and workout changes to improve overall fitness/health, this watch is for you. I have had Fitbit since 2009. I have been a loyal customer. I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I love this watch. The health breakdown is incredible. It is so detailed. It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about. For example walking stability or walking asymmetry? Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry? It links to the health app in the iPhone. In there everything is broken down. It has pushed me to exercise more. I am a video gamer. This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score. If you game, you know how addicting that challenge can be. I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch, and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit. The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life. The battery life is pretty bad. I have to charge it every day. Do not let that impact your decision to buy this. Since that is the only flaw I have found with the watch I give this product 5 stars. Also, beware that this does not come with the plug adapter. It comes with the charging cord. I guess Apple no longer includes the plugs with their products, they only include the cord. I am very happy with this purchase. I have retired my Fitbit completely. I was pretty sedentary until I purchased this watch. If you love Apple and you want to change your health/workout patterns, get this watch. There are so many cool apps to get to track other things you might want to track. I got this on prime day, so the price was a lower. Overall, the money you spend on this is well worth it. I got the GPS+Cellular. You do have to take the watch to your mobile carrier to set up the cellular. It is swim proof and water aerobic proof. As usual, Apple prevails. I also like that this is a super user friendly device as are all Apple products that I have ever used. If you want to track sleep, there are multiple apps to track it, so do not let that deter you from buying this. Also, Apple has great customer service. They are available online or on the phone 24/7. I hope everyone who buys this enjoys this as much as I do. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Apple! Initially, my husband and I bought our Apple Watches from the Apple store 10 days before Amazon prime day (We had 4 days until the return window closes), so when I saw it\\x92s on sale for $120 less each, total of $260(tax included) I decided to return the ones we bought from Apple store and buy these ones on Amazon.\\nMy husband was adamant to buy it from Amazon, especially after reading all kinds of reviews about how people got empty boxes or bad watches.\\nEventually, we bought the watches and we are so glad we took the chance. We got everything that came with the watches, and there was no sign that the package has been messed with. The only complaint I have is that there is a little tear on the box; I keep all my Apple products boxes so I need all my boxes to look a certain way lol.\\nOverall, our watches are great! Charges super fast and battery life is great. Make sure to turn off \\x93always on Apple Watch face\\x94 to maximize the battery power.\\nNot saying the bad reviews are lies; but with Amazon and any other online stores, it\\x92s always a risk you\\x92re taking the moment you click add to cart and buy it now.\\nBuy it if it\\x92s on sale; return it, if it doesn\\x92t work for you. I\\x92d wanted a Watch for years, then noticed Amazon offered the basic Series 7 GPS 41mm in green for $284 on Prime Day. I thought about it overnight while I did a bit of research.\\n\\nThe Series 7 has been out a while, but apparently the coming Series 8 will not see a major functional upgrade beyond outward design. It\\x92s expected to have the same battery, SoC and sensors, all packed in a flatter, rather, less-rounded case of similar size.\\n\\nMost users purchasing through Amazon report original equipment in new condition. Sure, there\\x92s always going to be an unfortunate few who receive a factory defective product, but at this price I was willing to risk the time and potential headache of exchange or refund. I purchased it without difficulty and received it within a few days. Upon unboxing, all packaging, components and accessories were pristine and in perfect working order.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I danced a happy little jig around my table as I realized, for once, things actually turned out in my favor.\\n\\nIn the last few weeks of wearing it each day, I appreciate its many capabilities. Though I do presume none are here to read how convenient a certain feature remains. Yet the main point I\\x92ll relay is the realistic expectation of a full day\\x92s battery life. I keep it on all day except for the ~20 minutes I set it down to charge each afternoon or evening depending on activities. I leave the screen always-on at max brightness and run various tracking, control, and communication apps continuously. Overall, it\\x92s helped to make life a little easier. These days, I\\x92ll take all the help I can get! This is my fourth Apple watch. I\\x92ve purchased the series 0, series 1, 2, two series 4. One stainless, one aluminum. The 4 is such a great watch, I never felt the need to upgrade. I recently paid Apple $ 79 to replace my battery. They actually replaced the watch. I\\x92ve never had a problem with any Apple watch. I purchased the 7, because of a great Amazon price.\\n\\nStainless steel vs aluminum. Both are great. I put one bad scratch on my aluminum crystal. It doesn\\x92t affect function, and it only shows when the watch is dark. It happened when my watch hit the rough edge of our granite countertop. My SS has never scratched.\\n\\nWhy spend the extra money to get the stainless? If you want a GPS only model, the SS is $ 300 more than the aluminum. If you want cellular capability, the difference drops to $ 200. Due to health issues, my wife convinced me to get the cellular capability. In an emergency, these will call 911, even when your phone is not around, and even when you don\\x92t subscribe for service. That\\x92s important.\\n\\nThe series 7 has a blood oxygen measurement feature. During Covid, we purchased two different fingertip devices to measure blood oxygen. We were disappointed with both. The watch oxygen measurement works seamlessly. We consider it worth buying for that feature alone.\\n\\nSummary.\\n\\nIf you want cellular capability, spend the extra $ 200 for SS. If you don\\x92t, buy the aluminum model and save $ 300.\\nBoth are great watches. The color is even more fab in person and the specs on this make my upgrade perfection! I\\'ve enjoyed putting the health app feature to it\\'s max use FINALLY after all these years of wishing/wanting. It was easy to set everything up and the features work exactly as advertised making for a great start on keeping track of ALL the things I probably ought to but never had the opportunity beforehand! The battery life is great, I can get a full charge while I hop in the shower literally after wearing it much of the day & using it to the max with both navigation while driving & my health app as well as for my music/with my airpods for work. the battery hasn\\'t run down on me yet & I\\'ve used it pretty heavily over the past week since it arrived. I even got a decent charge using the cord that came with my version 3 (I had to wait on a new plug to arrive so I could use the newer version which is even speedier than the older one! Moral of the story is either charging cord works great, the newer is just faster is all, but I didnt find the old one particularly slow by contrast which is great to know!) I just happily passed down my 3 to my daughter who was delighted to be able to finally have the meditation app for her anxiety & I haven\\'t looked back since handing it off! My new watch is great, the battery lasts & charges speedily AND it has enough room to store all my apps that I want to use unlike my older watch that was constantly maxing out on the simplest of things/minimal use. I\\'m very happy with my upgrade! First of all I read many people complain about the charger, If you read before you will see exactly what comes with the watch and what you will need. I have a old SE iPhone, My first step was to install os 15 wish I did with no issues. After that was done I paired my watch with no problem. I keep the face off and I can go 2 days with no charging and I really use it a lot. The alarm is a plus for me. Sound is super clear . I can go swimming with no worries and track my exercise. The oxygen is another plus for since I have asthma I can keep a track when I\\'m sick. I also recommend baying the insurance for a 2 year extended warranty. Is not expensive and its really worth it. for a 300hundred dollar watch. I bought this Apple Watch mainly to track my heart rate and sleep tracking, but also for using the wallet feature for opening my college dorm doors that are locked unless ID is presented when I go back to college in a month.\\nFrom using the first ever Apple Watch, this is definitely a BIG upgrade. The screen is very large compared to older models. Personally, I wish the battery lasted a little longer. But, the battery does last me about 2 days with always on display turned off. Very easy to setup with the Watch app, not difficult at all.\\nI see so many reviews complaining about the USB-C connector as a charger. Almost all Apple products use USB-C on one end of the cable, and I don\\x92t understand why you would complain so much, as you should already have one, or go and buy one. Not a big deal.\\nAnother thing to mention, Apple doesn\\x92t use the \\x93plastic wrap\\x94 on some of their products, and the Apple Watch is one of them. Apple does it for environmental reasons. No one opened it, that is how Amazon and other stores receive them from apple. If something is wrong, Amazon will help you, don\\x92t complain on a review before asking Amazon for help.\\nOverall great watch, and it was at a great price when purchased. Grabbed an official solo loop band from apple, and I can barely tell the watch is there. I\\'ve wanted an apple watch for a long time to help me with my physical fitness and sleep tracking. So, when I saw that it was on sale, it was finally time to make the purchase. I am not disappointed in any way. It is simply a fantastic device. The fit and finish are beautiful and the functionality is excellent.\\n\\nTwo other points that I\\'d suggest a potential buyer keep in mind:\\n- There is a ton of functionality here and it takes a while to learn. Don\\'t be like me and just skip the tutorials. They contain good information that will allow a new user to get up to speed more quickly.\\n- I may get a different wristband. The one that comes with my watch tends to pinch my wrist when I exercise and I find myself being distracted by it. I\\'m not saying that there is a better option, because I haven\\'t found one yet. But other watches I\\'ve had haven\\'t been that way. YMMV\\n\\nHope this helps someone. After ordering and receiving it today (after being delayed) I opened it to find the battery is completely dead. It\\x92s been charging for a about 20 minutes, but still shows the red lightning bolt for needing a charge. It is concerning, as a dead battery could pose other problems.\\nEdited on day 3: Apparently the reserve charge can drain the longer it sits. It did take longer than stated to charge, but now seems to be working ok. My biggest need is to track my heart rate, and that is working, so far. The battery does not last anywhere near as long as my Fitbit and it does need charging before bed in order to track sleep, which was another conundrum as it didn\\x92t ask during sleep set up as it should have. It did not track sleep the first night (despite being set up to do so in the app on my phone), so I reset it hoping set up would ask (it did not). It ultimately did track on night 2.\\nOtherwise, the green on the band is a little brighter than army green, which is nice and the actual watch is more black than green which will enable easier band swapping.\\nAfter using a Fitbit for years, it will take some getting used to, but I am hoping the increased functionality and Apple will give more reliability than the Fitbit (which each I had ended up with a warranty replacement in the first year). I have been a consumer of Apple products for a very long time. When I saw the discounted series 7 Apple watch during Amazon Prime Days, I decided it was time to upgrade from my series three. I love the added viewing space. Going from the 38 to the 41mm screen seems small, but somehow Apple made it seem bigger. I love the blood oxygen, ekg, and fall detection features, and they work beautifully and easily. I am extremely happy with my purchase. Now\\x85.here\\x92s the downside\\x85.\\n\\nThe watch that I purchased through Amazon was defective. It seems the sensors were not working. The battery also would not hold a charge. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple trying to troubleshoot the problem, and it was determined that I needed to exchange it. Unfortunately, since I did not purchase the watch directly from Apple, I needed to go through the Amazon return process. Apple would service the watch but not exchange it. The return through Amazon required more steps than a regular return, but it worked, and I got my money back. It was just a little disappointing to have to wait another week before being able to make the exchange. Once my money was refunded, I went to Apple and purchased another watch. In the future I will purchase Apple products directly from the store to save the extra steps if there is a problem. I reserved buying an AppleWatch as I had always used FitBits and my main goal for a while was steps and weight loss. I still think if you want a pure pedometer fitbit is better, but not by too much. The computability with my iPhone makes it an amazing device were I wish I had gotten an Apple Watch a lot sooner. I most recently went with a fitbit sense and my wife has a Versa. We both had connectivity issues and always needed to have the fitbit app open to be able to sync to the phone. This applewatch is always synced which makes it smoother. Apps extend to the watch and the battery charges fast. I wear my watch all day and if I want to track sleep, charge it about an hour before bed and it lasts through the night and the entire next day. Everything about this watch is almost perfect! The only \\x93bad\\x94 thing about it is the battery life. It isn\\x92t terrible but for a $300-400 watch it should last for at least 3-4 days in one charge. I can get up to 2 days max in 1 charge.\\n\\nDurability is very good. I use this watch to workout and all sports. However I manage to get a couple of scratches on my watch by accidentally bumping into the wall. I recommend to get a screen cover for the watch if your scared of scraping your watch on surfaces or walls.\\n\\nBesides those 2 \\x93negatives\\x94, I believe this watch to be the one of if not the best watch for everything IF you have an iPhone.\\n\\nI bought the cellular one and it\\x92s very convenient to not need to worry about missed calls if I don\\x92t have my phone with me.\\n\\nI also use this watch for Apple Pay and it\\x92s super convenient! I just might start leaving my wallet at home lol.\\n\\nOverall I think this is a great all around watch.\\n\\nP.S I don\\x92t recommend to upgrade watches if you have a series 5,SE,6 I like this watch! It\\x92s great, but I\\x92m gonna be brutality honest. While I enjoy my apple products an can admire that they want to keep it user friendly. This watch gives you a-lot of apps that allows you to work alongside your iPhone. It is fun to use and nice to look at. Although there are a lot of great things this watch provides I personally believe that there could of been a lot more incorporated in this generation of watch to make it better. The battery life is alright I\\x92d give it. A 4/10 it requires a lot of charging if you put it to use, which is understandable, just a bit frustrating. The big one is nice if you have a large arm, wrist, and fingers. The buttons are tiny so they have added a microphone, so you can talk into for it either for phone calls or voice chat to text instead of typing. If you have the money or want one I\\x92d say why not? The more popular they get the, better they be sooner, at least I\\x92d like to hope. As far as a future watch I\\x92d like to see it be thinner while being more comfortable with a better battery life. Be creative apple I just don\\x92t want to get cancer form wearing a watch that could give off radiation and give us all cancer. I kill watches. Over the years, every non-name brand, jewelry gift inexpensive and expensive has been abused to the death. My first thought was I would do that to this one, too. I hand wash dishes everyday, never remember to take it off before I shower, and garden and do handy work. But I appreciate knowing how much I have walked and being reminded to stand up and take a break, getting messages the moment they are sent and not being chained to the phone. The medical monitoring works, too. I am very happy with this device I once thought was silly. Glad I bought it. When these watches first came out I thought why would I need one of these. Well I really still don\\x92t need one but I am sure glad I have it. When Amazon had it for $70.00 off I said why not. I love it and I\\x92m having so much fun with it. The only time I take it off is to charge it and with the rapid charger it\\x92s not off for long. I keep it on at night because I can\\x92t see my own clock with out my glasses and it has an automatic dimmer so it doesn\\x92t blare in my eyes. It keeps track of my steps which I find is way too low. I love answering it when you can\\x92t get to your phone in time and when I\\x92m at the grocery store no need to get your phone out at all. If people think I\\x92m talking to myself let them, it\\x92s all good. LOL Last night I used its flashlight and could not believe how bright it was. I love changing the faces especially using the one with hand selected pictures from your phone. It\\x92s nice to look at your watch and seeing a loved one that has passed smiling up at you. There are so many faces to choose from too. My husband bought me a Tag Heuer for our 20th anniversary 15 years ago. I am I watch person I like to switch watches to go with my outfit or how I am feeling that day. With a Tag and that price tag you kind of feel like you have to wear it every day. With my Apple Watch and it\\x92s ability to modify in so many different ways I feel like I\\x92m wearing a different one every day. I still have my Tag but now only wear it for special occasions. Delivery was same day and was excellent. The watch I must say is beautiful. I chose the Red color and the display is very brilliant. There are a lot of apps that you can download. Charging time is between an hour and hour and half to full capacity. I get a full 2 days with out having to charge it again. The band has a nice soft feel to it and sometimes it doesn\\'t feel like I am wearing a watch.\\nThe health apps do have some disclaimers so I don\\'t read to much into it. For me I call it for entertaining purposes. My opinion is the results must me somewhere in the ballpark.\\nI have used the sleep app that came with the watch but only allows you to set an alarm. I already know I\\'m a poor sleeper I don\\'t think I need an app to tell me that.\\nI ride my bike and there is a cool feature that detects that your riding a bike and records the miles,speed and calories. I do workout at the gym, but it doesn\\'t record the machine I\\'m using or calories I have burned. Will need to investigate. I have had the watch for nearly a month, and I highly recommend it. I wasn\\'t going to succumb to the pressure of purchasing an Apple Watch, but finally relented. I really liked my Garmin except for the size and clunkiness of the design. It\\'s served me well for over 7 years. Only thing I don\\'t like about the Apple Watch is the short battery life. I\\'ve removed almost all tracking functions and I still only get about 24 hrs. on a charge. I may be doing something wrong, but either I charge at night and don\\'t get sleep data or charge during day and don\\'t get motion data. I\\'ve owned several pricey fitness watches in the past (e.g. Garmin, Polar, etc.) and all of them crapped out at one point or another. I considered purchasing higher-end models hoping that they would last when I stumbled upon a youtube review by a wonderful German physiologist?, whatever his profession, his analysis and review of several models always ended up with Apple at the top. I am not one to promote or support mega-businesses in general as their, to be kind, unethical means of achieving that status angers me, but I have to give credit where credit is due. There is nothing I do not love about this watch, from it\\' amazing features, (discovering new ones daily) its sleek design, its versatility, its user-friendliness, and yes, truth be told, its affordability. The only issue I have with it, and this is specific to me and not the watch, is my sensitivity to the material on it\\'s underside. Alloyed metals and the like often make me its and give me a rash. I affixed a piece of thin athletic tape to my wrist and problem solved. Reading are the same as without. All I can say is \\'well done, Apple!\" I will test it\\'s durability and report back in 6 months. This was watch was purchased to replace a standard watch that failed but it has proven that it is worth its weight in gold to me now. Favorite feature is I have a loaded calendar with meeting and appointments, and this watch will notify me discreetly while I am currently attending a meeting with out being rude in front of whom I am meeting by a phone flash or having to flip my phone over to read the display. I can put my phone away and truly give my undivided attention to whomever is needing it at the time as well as staying on time for the upcoming meetings still on the calendar! A must for someone with a busy professional lifestyle! First off this watch saved my life!! I have never been diagnosed with Afib. This past Friday night my watch told me I was in Afib and I went to the ER. My heart rate was 147 bears a minute. Had I not had this watch I would have just thought I was having an anxiety attack. The battery life on this thing last longer then I would have imagined. You can do so many things with it. It\\x92s comfortable to wear and just absolutely amazing for the price!!! I feel everyone should own one My fitbit after 5 yrs decided it didnt want to keep a charge so on prime day decided to get the apple watch. I was skeptical but after a month of every day wear growing to like it more. Wish I could find a better sleep app to match more like the fitbit had, but I\\'ve played around with a few of the add on apps and found one I like ok. Lots of bells and whistles that I\\'m not used to but I\\'m getting there. I\\'m not one of those high end geeks who have a lot of apps it monitors, just the practical ones. I especially like if I am away from my phone I can answer a call from the watch. Nifty. One of my better choices for the amazon prime days. I just upgraded from my Apple Watch 3. Can you believe I\\x92ve waited so long. Hey it still works perfectly. There are no problems with my old one. I wanted the new one for the bigger face, 41mm for my small wrist. It\\x92s a wonderful instrument to have on your wrist. I don\\x92t have to tell all the metrics it tracks. I particularly keep the heart rate, workout, weather and calendar for my complications. I keep a watchful eye on my heart rate. Getting older, these features give you a quick look at how your heart is doing. And it\\x92s doing fine. But it\\x92s good to know that it will contact my emergency contacts if any it can detect that is off occurs. Overall, I love it, have always loved it. It\\x92s only off my wrist when it\\x92s charging or I\\x92m in the shower. Only point I\\x92d take off is that the battery doesn\\x92t last any longer than my old one. It just charges faster. But it never did take long charging. Hopefully one day, they can improve the battery life. I purchased an Apple Watch seven even though I rarely like to wear watches and I already had an Apple Watch three. The reason I did this was to try to make sure that I didn\\x92t have any sleep apnea issues as I\\x92ve been accused of snoring and wanted to make sure that that didn\\x92t indicate any potential problems. So far the watch seems to indicate that I\\x92m OK I\\x92m not sure that all of these observations are full proof because they\\x92re done randomly throughout my sleep cycle so it may take a couple of months before anything bad shows up. I have found the watch is really handy when I\\x92m cycling and I\\x92ve grown to like it very much. Great purchase! I love the Apple Watch i can comment on sleep tracking since I don\\x92t wear it at night .\\nIt charges pretty quick and yes the battery last about a day but considering all that it can do and how often I used is to be expected.\\nI love how the GPS vibrates and shows the directions as well as distance for next turn. So it make it easy to not get distracted.\\nI can also ask Siri to send text messages and make calls as long as the cellphone is nearby, I hadn\\x92t test the distance.\\nThe other thing is that can also be use as a light, app that helps you with breathing techniques.\\nThe oximeter and heart rate monitors work good.\\n\\nI was really impress with all the functions that can do. Also can work as a remote to take photos from your phone. My son loves the Apple Watch we got him as a birthday gift. He has not taken it off. He loves all the clock face options. He tracks his exercise times. He maps his walks/runs. He often tracks the heart rate. He will show me a new clock face every other day and is so happy to have all the choices. Sadly we ordered on Amazon Day, hoping for a quick delivery in time for his birthday. But the watch was over a month delayed. And it kept getting delayed further and further. We love Apple products and now was have all five in our family. Very highly recommeded! Llevo un par de semanas utilizándolo y me ah gustado mucho, es un buen upgrade para mi, ya que nunca había comprado uno, si tienes uno de generación 6 o 5, yo creo que aun puedes esperar hasta que salga uno con mejores actualizaciones, como el 8 o futuros Apple Watch.\\nLO QUE NO ME GUSTO: No viene con el adaptador para cargar la batería, solo viene con el cable, a mi me toco conectarlo a mi computadora para ahorrarme dinero. It has a lot of information on it so yeah the battery isn\\x92t gonna last a long time. But fine with me! I am getting so much information during the day exercise steps heart calls messages ! And I can keep my phone in my pocket . I like the awards it makes you keep going.. hard to see since I bought a cover for it but I wanted to match my phone\\nLove the different watch faces! Pretty cool watch, tons of features & battery last a longgg time which is Great! Little pricey & cellular service is limited & not available for all cell phone Providers like consumer cellular so check your cell phone provider before purchasing to make sure they offer service for the Apple Watch. I Have to switch providers now but I should have checked before purchase. Other than that it\\x92s a awesome watch. I have been an Apple user for many years but always thought buying the Watch was costly. I\\x92d had Fitbit Charge 4 and then Charge 5 until they started failing. So I started looking at the Apple Watch on Amazon with Prime Days coming up. I went into Costco to look at one in person since the Apple Store is in the mall and not easy for me to walk to. Anyways, I ordered the blue GPS version, knowing I\\x92d have to get the charging block and added the 2 year AppleCare pkg. There was an offer to get $200 off if I applied for the Prime card. It was delivered the day after I placed the order, the brick 2 days later. I also ordered the hard screen protector ( set of 2). I was able to set it up fairly easily, I have had it now for 3 days and have tried several of the features. So far, the one con is trying to respond to a text on the Watch. The keyboard is predictive and if you try to X out what you type, it\\x92s right under the Send. So my texts have been incomplete with typos. Fat finger syndrome! I changed the size of the text to help me see what I entered which helped a bit. I\\x92m left handed so the Watch is on my left wrist. Typing with the right hand is not the easiest for me, so will be working on improving my right handed typing or using the dictation more often. So far, am glad to have bit the bullet. I love the blue, the size of the face, the ability to change faces, listen to music, so many features! Everyone thinks they know what is an Apple Watch. I had no idea how much having this piece of technology on my wrist would be so helpful in my everyday life.\\nI find the notifications useful (not annoying) because I see them instantly and don\\x92t end up retrieving a phone full of stuff I have to deal with all at once.\\nMislaying my phone is a bad habit so I use that app a lot. I wish I had gone for the bigger screen but was reluctant because of my small wrist. Replying to texts would be easier.\\nAnswering calls is fun. Tracking sleep and the health details are why I bought this model.\\nGetting free online advice about making the most out of the watch has proven very useful though I have not cracked taking a photo yet.\\n\\nI am disappointed with the battery life .(sometimes it does not last the day) and also with the screen which scratches very easily. I got a plastic film protector very soon after buying when I realised that I already had scratch damage. It has not affected the performance or look of the watch in any way. Love my purchase. I think this New Series 7 Apple Watch is great! It is easy to use and the \"Always On\" Face is a big improvement over the older versions. The Apps work great and I really like the Heart Beat Measurement and the O2 Level Measurements. It also does a ECG that can be looked at on the iPhone in greater detail. The Watch Faces are Super and I like the \"Infograph\" Version that I can put 4 functions around the edge of the clock face and 4 App Shortcuts in the center! I am using a Deimiko Watch Band that does a great job protecting the Watch Face. I still haven\\'t figured out all the things this watch can do. But it was easy to set up and pair with my iPhone. There are no instructions included so you go online to search them out. Needed to charge battery almost every night. great for finding my iPhone when misplaced.\\nI tried to \"live\" with the size of the screen but ended up returning so I can order the larger size as my eyes were having difficulty reading many of the apps..THANK YOU Amazon for the easy return..although I haven\\'t received the credit yet, but it\\'s only been 2 days I was really concerned about choosing the 45mm GPS model (Blue .....was really leaning toward Red) as I have never owned an Apple watch. In fact, I have not worn any type of watch for decades. I must say, for me, I am extremely glad I went with the Apple 45mm. I have only had it a few days. One of the things that impresses me the most is it is not nearly as \"heavy\" as I had read. The Always On feature makes it so easy to quickly see the time and the curved design allows one to read the time at all angles. For the Face, I choose Photos in which you can choose up to 24 photos. The clarity of these is beyond expectation. Colors are true to reality; not dimmed; not fuzzy.; not distorted. Absolutely a treasure. As I have been a medical transcriptionist for 25-years (and counting), having the watch encourage me to Stand is a plus. Also, having the ability to run an EKG and check blood oxygen level are additional pluses. Would I get another Apple Watch? By all means, yes. Will I get different bands? Yes. The choices are almost endless. :) That being said, love the watch. Plenty of features from multiple watch face to health tracking. I love that when I am using maps on Applecar play, the watch pulses when I have to make a turn. Unfortunately, I am retired so I now longer wear my watch all the time. I really like the feature that tells me to stand up once an hour. :D I was upgrading from a series 4. My series 4 was getting maybe 18 hours on a full charge when it was brand new, but had deteriorated to needing to be charged 3-4 times per day. This new one has had amazing battery life for me. I have had it for about a month and right now it has been 25 hours since my last full charge and it is at 27% battery. It has been averaging 27-28 hours from fully charged to 10%. My series 4 was 40mm and this one is 41mm. I didn\\x92t expect 1mm to make such a big difference but it really does (as you can see in the picture I attached). When I first bought the watch, it died 9 hours after charging. I was so upset and saw a lot of people have battery problems with the series 7. I switched the screen to a simpler background and turned off the background refresh for most apps and it was still dying.\\n\\nAfter a few days, it got better and now I can use whatever screen background I want and I don\\x92t have to charge it every day. So give it time to adjust! I\\x92m super happy with my watch and it\\x92s a huge upgrade from my Series 1! I had a series 3 and a series 4 Apple watch. I wore the series 3 while I sleep and the series 4 during the day and would charge the one I wasn\\'t currently using. I gave my sister the series 3 after I received the Series 7. I do the same thing with the series 4 and 7 as I did with the series 3 and 4. All you need to do is to go to Apple\\'s site to see all the functions the series 7 does. The main differences I notice from the series 4 to the 7 are:\\nLonger battery life\\nFaster charging\\nLarger better screen\\nThe Blood Oxygen function\\nIt appears to be faster at running apps\\n\\nThe main reason I was in the market for a new Apple watch was because the series 3 will not be compatible with the next Apple watchOS 9 coming out later this year. I\\x92m so happy I bought this watch. I have envied other people who had Apple watches. It\\x92s comfortable to wear, though I did replace the strap to one that had a regular fastener. Too bad they put such a difficult watchband on an expensive watch. But it works great and I was specially happy to buy it with interest free payments to Amazon for 12 months. I hesitated to get this because of the cost and I wasn\\'t sure how much I would use it. But after having a fall on a trail I wanted the fall detection feature as a safety measure. And this watch turned out to be so much more than that. It even has a timer for hand washing and I\\'m still learning about all of its amazing health and exercise tracking features. I can make and answer phone calls and messages without having to get my iPhone out of my day pack or pocket. And as far as how much I would use my watch, I wear it everyday from the time that I get up until bedtime. Highly recommend. I don\\x92t really use my Apple Watch when I have access to my phone. The sleep tracking is okay, it\\x92ll be better once the new watch OS update comes out because then it\\x92ll track your REM, light sleep, deep sleep, etc. Right now it\\x92s just the amount of hours you slept. Which isn\\x92t as exciting. I find this SUPER useful when walking my dog. My dog likes to pull, and it\\x92s nice to look at wrist if I get a text and not have to use my other hand lol to pull out my phone. Voice dictation is handy when it works (85% of the time). If you like to go out and not worry about your phone getting stolen in passing, this is great. I can change the volume of the music and skip to the next song with this watch. I can look at my Google maps with this watch if I want to walk somewhere but not have my phone out. It has a lot of capabilities and it\\x92s sleek. One other thing I love using it for (besides all the health stuff), I can look at my reminders easily. I like this a lot since I use that to have my grocery list. If I want to quickly add something to the list without taking my phone out I can or I can easily walk around the grocery store and check things off on my wrist rather than having a paper list of looking at my phone. What did I do before I owned this watch? Pick up my phone like one of the poors? Now I know everything at every second of the day. All the news, all of my health, all of my habits, all of the texts and calls I\\x92m ignoring. Everything. I can start my car with my watch. I can open and close my garage with my watch. I have a timer on my wrist! I am truly living high on the hog. The one thing I can\\x92t do? Get that dang walk-in talkie to work! ?? I love my watch I\\x92m not really computer savvy and it was easy to connect with my phone.. it connects to Siri and she is easy to use , u can also talk to people on ur watch. If u r walking or exercising at all u can keep track of it with ur watch. That is all I really have to say . Purchased during Prime Days. No regrets. Easy setup and very comfortable. I use the Workout app for my daily walks. At the same time, I use the Podcast app, which provides control of all the necessary podcast functions while I walk. The Heart Rate app is fantastic! I also love the activity app that tracks my step count and other health attributes. I find the Messages app useful as well, allowing me to leave the phone in my pocket. The querty keyboard works amazingly well, but I also like dictating messages. I am preferring the Infograph Modular watch face as it is easiest for me to read and provides easy access to my preferred complications (battery life, activities, workout and podcasts). I wasn\\x92t going to get an Apple Watch. After doing much research into which model would be best for me, I chose the series 7 on black with a black band. I love it! It has so many useful apps that are pertinent to my lifestyle. And it\\x92s fun! I\\x92m so glad I decided to purchase. Love this series watch from Apple. If you are conservative with the notifications you allow to push to your watch\\x85. then the battery life is outstanding-truly. I can go two full days (plus) before needing to charge my watch. And with the charging cord included, you can charge the watch in approximately 45 minutes. This was an awesome purchase. I researched periodically for a year waiting for the right device. I bought an Oura ring last year but was disappointed with the way results are displayed. I got dizzy and lost my balance, then tripped and fell in my kitchen both the same week. Then apple watches went on sale during prime days. This watch has Fall Detection.... yes, please!! On top of that there are so many watch faces to choose from. You can switch the watch faces simply by swiping sideways on your watch!! So fun. It\\'s almost like having your phone and apps on your wrist. This watch is so incredibly versatile and impressive it has features to please just about anyone. Battery life is better\\x85 but the screen is what really got me. Brighter and easier to read. I had a version 3 for years - no problems but wanted to upgrade \\x85 very happy. I don\\x92t wear for sleep often but the data is interesting. Still not where fitbits where for battery but offer so much more I was convinced that I didn\\x92t this device, but my relatives talked me into it. I use it more than I ever thought I would. The voice texting is more accurate than my iPhone. I am an elderly man and use all the health features daily. I could go and on, but I love it. I had the first series of apple watch. It lasted me about 7 years, I was hoping it would last even longer (LOL), but the face lifted off. I watched a YouTube vide on how to purchase a special glue and glue it back down. That worked for about 7 months and again the face separated from the watch (apparently this is an issue as many of my friends experienced the same thing, and I hope Apple has fixed that problem). Prime day I finally ordered this watch and it\\'s great! I wish they still had the 38mm available for the new apple watches, but the 41mm wasn\\'t too much bigger though (I could not find the 7 series in a 40mm). This watch has amazing new features. Glad I upgraded, and I hope this watch last at least 7 years! Initially I couldn\\'t justify spending the money on one of these when the series 1 and series 2 didn\\'t really do it for me. I ended up purchasing it on sale because why not. I was extremely impressed. Not only is the screen super crisp but the build quality is a lot better, and feels better. I also LOVE the sleep tracking and the fitness app encourages me to get some exercise and close my rings. I never thought a watch would get me outside and moving. I also can leave my phone at home during walks and listen to the music I downloaded to the watch. I went from not even wanting one to being in the mind set where I\\'d buy a new one tomorrow if this one broke. I also turned off the \"always on display\" and get over 2 days without a charge. Love it. I surprised my husband with an apple watch when I saw it on sale and picked the green as it looks less casual/workout and more daywear. It comes with two sizes for the bands; I will say the large band runs very large. He\\'s been loving it and learning the functions of the watch easily. I wish I bought a screen protector too, but so far no issues. This size head is definitely better than the smaller one for use and vision; it just looks nicer too. Anniversary present for my husband. He hasn\\x92t worn a watch in years and didn\\x92t think he would bother to wear this either.\\nOur son showed him all of the amazing things the watch can do for you. He LOVES it and wishes I would have bought him one sooner. This is my second Apple Watch. I love it. It tracks my steps, heart rate, steadiness, walking asymmetry, and many other things. The battery life isn\\x92t quite as good as i wish but ok. And I love my Minnie Mouse face and her cute little voice. Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!! It barely ever has to charge and when it does it charges super fast. Comes with a lot of fun features that the 5 didn\\x92t. He loves how it can track his health even when he\\x92s sleeping. I love this watch, it stays charged from 7am to 12pm on a normal busy day, tracks all my steps and fitness, and also have helpful apps like calculator just in case you gotta do quick math. By far the best investment on my person on 2022 I bought this on Prime Day so I got it for a good price. So glad I purchased this watch. Love how it mirrors my phone. It can do a multitude of things from track your sleep to countdown washing your hands etc etc. there\\x92s so much you can do with this watch. My new fav! I resisted buying an Apple Watch for a long time, but finally caved when I was choosing between renewing a subscription that accompanies my stationary bike or doing something different. I chose the \"different,\" and don\\'t regret it for a second. Tracking my daily activity is much more reliable; I\\'m not completely tethered to my phone to capture all my steps! The gamified rings offers a nice sense of accomplishment as well, particularly important for those who have a burning need to check something off the list every day. I got the green one during the prime day sale because it was the best price. Swapped the band for a black one and the green watch is now very subtle. It lasts two days on a charge if I\\x92m not recording long work outs and the interface is noticeably snappier compared to the three. Siri works much better for me and the screen has a lot more real estate without making the watch noticeably larger. Love the watch but every time I turn around it needs to be charged. I don\\x92t remember my previous Apple Watch having to be charged before each day comes to an end\\x85 that\\x92s my only complaint \\x85 otherwise it does everything I want and more!!! I expected to find the Apple Watch Series 7 in blue (my favorite color) to be useful, but I did not realize how much the watch can do. Am still discovering all the ways the watch can help me be organized, in touch, & healthy. Love this Apple Watch for working out and keeping myself accountable. I don\\x92t mind that there\\x92s no GPS option on it either it\\x92s just fine. I\\x92ve never used the sleep tracking option but I like the other health monitors it includes. Am really impressed with the clarity of the calls I can heated the caller and vice versa I didn\\x92t know if and Apple Watch was really nessacery but now I don\\x92t like to be with out it Love love love it!!!! I love my Apple Watch 7. This is my first time to buy a smartwatch and I\\x92m glad I bought the latest one. Worth all the money! I guess it depends on really what you need. I\\x92m in it for the fitness tracking, plus the customizations I can do with it are just superb.\\n\\nTook 15-20 mins to pair it up with my iPhone. My package was packed well and shipped right away. A hassle-free transaction. I had the watch 1 so the watch 7 was a big upgrade for me. I like that I can swim or take showers with it on skiing with the other features. I\\x92m a big some fan Good bargain,glad I got one . wish it had longer battery life but it makes it up in other ways. great gift for someone or for yourself. never unhappy with any of my other products by them. I really like my new watch. I love the blue color, the size and the connection to my phone. There is a lot of things that I haven\\x92t checked into but hopefully I will find time to do it. The Apple Watch 7 series is another incremental step forward in the Apple Watch family of devices. The battery life is improved over the series 6 devices and the new blood oxygen monitoring is a nice feature.\\n\\nSleep tracking is OK, but not yet on par with the fitbit sleep tracking functionality. Hopefully apple will catch up eventually with this functionality. While the battery life is improved, it is still also one of the weak points of the device. You will be charging your watch every 48 hours at a minimum. Compared to a fitbit which lasts almost a week, this is a notable weakness.\\n\\nAll that being said, if you are invested in the apple iPhone and iOS ecosystem, there is no better smartwatch on the market. I upgraded from a Series 3 to the Series 7 (45mm). The size of the screen is incredible. Not too big for my small wrist in my opinion. Being able to type a text on a full keyboard is a game changer. The \\x93always on\\x94 screen is cool, but does drain the battery. I charge my watch every night and after 14 hours the battery has about 30% remaining. Not a big deal to me, but if you want the battery to last multiple days perhaps turn off this setting. The rapid charge is truly rapid - charges fully in 1-2 hours. Would highly recommend! The watch works great . I used the batteries lasted longer . I feel like I\\x92m charging it everyday . I\\x92m still getting used to how to use it . But I love it. I went from a Fitbit to an Apple Watch . I like that the Fitbit tracked steps , vs calories. Talking in the phone and exiting off the phone watch is great. I use my watch for two things: keeping track of my activity during the day, and notifications.\\nWith an easily customizable watch face, I can keep track of multiple things during the day without having to touch my watch.\\nThe ping is loud enough if you want it to be, the font size is customizable.\\nOverall a great product.\\nHave not yet tested in water. This is my first Apple Watch. I love it. I\\x92m happy with the battery life and think it charges pretty quickly. It\\x92s fast and works well in partnership with my phone. I moved from a series 5 to this series 7 and it seems much better to me. The bigger screen helps and it\\x92s just faster and has more goodies. I recommend the Apple Watch series 7. I was impressed with the battery life as it last about 2 days and charges fairly quick. I was worried about the face being too big on my small wrist but it feels/looks good. Hi I have had an Apple Watch for many years. This series 7 however, provides vital information concerning my health in regards to my vitals. This watch is more than I could even imagine. I initially was going to get an SE until this went on sale for Prime Day, so I went with this one due to the massive savings. Aside from being a tiny bit bigger that number one thing that makes this watch better for me is the always-on screen. It does dim a bit but it is always on and it brightens up when you raise it. There are tons of other features but this is the number one thing for me that makes this watch better. Sadly Apple has since raised their prices on hardware so you may have to wait until Black Friday now to get another deal. I just received the watch today and I love it. It was very easy to sync with the iPhone 11. There are a lot of options you have to consider but that\\x92s a good thing. I love everything about it except, guess what? There was no charging box. It just came with its USB c cable but no box! Fortunately I had a powerbank that will work until my wall charger arrives next week. Yes I had to order that separately. Still, I got a great deal on prime day so I\\x92m not complaining, just surprised let\\x92s say. I did my first workout on it and that was awesome too. Also made a phone call with it. Now that\\x92s convenient. Looks very classy too. Happy camper! My older version iwatch died and one of my complaints was the short battery life This iwatch last a minimum of 24 hours. I love being able to answer calls from my watch. I got this Apple watch for about 20% less than at the Apple store. Also was able to buy Apple Care here, too. A no brainer! Everything is great. My battery lasts almost two days with moderate use. It would be better if Apple would figure out how to make a better battery, but I\\'m not complaining. There aren\\'t many watchband options for the original purchase here, but save the hassle and buy a $15 knockoff watchband instead! This Apple Watch Series 7 GPS 45mm has so much to offer than the first one I had. I like the fact I can keep track of my health and well-being on one device. This is my 3rd Apple Watch and every time, they get better and better! The battery life is great the new health trackers are really cool, overall I love the new size. I had brought the fist one that came out years ago it finally broke so had to get another got the 7 live it faces is bigger that what I had Well, the watch is great but the pricing not so great. I paid $359 for it and only 2 weeks later the price is $329. Not happy at all. Still getting used to having a watch like this. The only thing I don\\x92t care for is the color of the band. Would have preferred white or pale pink.\\nI like that I was able to make the face larger print since my vision is not so great anymore.\\n\\nGoing to sign up for the free 3-month fitness trial next. I upgraded my Apple Watch series 2 to this one and it is world of difference. Battery life is great, though I am sure I had battery degradation on my series 2. Also I got it on prime day, so the fact that it was $120 off when compared to the apple store helps, lol. I am a huge fan of apple, but the capability and snappiness of the iOS is great. The new O2 levels are super cool. It is a genuine product, that was my only concern. If you are an Apple Watch person looking to upgrade this is a great deal. It does more than I expected. It EKG app. is fenomenon. Battery life does not last very long but watch charges fast with the charging cord and magnet provided by apple. I upgraded from the series one and I wore it everyday and this one had been a gam changer. I love it, the battery it SO much better too It\\'s amazing what can be fit \"into\" a watch these days, and Apple lives up to the hype. There\\'s a bit of a learning curve if you\\'ve never had an Apple watch before - for example mine was waking me up at 3 am telling me it was time to stand and walk for one minute. The battery was depleting very quickly due to all the apps and features. I had to decide which ones were important or useful for me, and turn off the rest. Even so, I\\'m a little disappointed in the battery life - charge goes down by 40% in 24 hours, and I do sleep with it, so I have to plug it in to charge every morning to be safe.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the watch comes with a charging cord but NOT the block to plug it into. I can understand not providing a regular USB block - I have multiple ways to charge USB, in fact many public facilities provide such access. USB-C is NOT widespread yet, so it\\'s an added expense to purchase one. Even though I was fore-warned, I was not pleased about that.\\n\\nStill, I like the health and exercise features, I like the preview of incoming calls and text messages, and I like being able to customize the home screen for quick information. I\\x92d resisted buying one for a long time, but now can\\x92t imagine not having it. It\\x92s very convenient and more discreet in meetings than pulling out my phone. If you\\x92ve had an Apple Watch in the past it\\x92s the same platform with a few new features like fall detection, heart rate notifications, emergency S.O.S. I bought mine because it was time for an upgrade and the price was right. If you have an Apple Watch I would recommend getting the watch. So far so good. Still learning new features and apps. Has been great after downloading an app to check my blood sugar, it will tell me if I am high or low with a warning. Actually made my first call thru my watch.\\nI\\'m sure I will be learning more each day. I feel safer now that I have a Watch that can recognize a hard fall with ptions to call one of two predesignated persons or 911 for help. I like the blood oxygen sensor. Weight is perfect and the remote camera feature makes vlogging easy from the iPhone. Size is sleek as well, just wish there were more shape options as opposed to the basic \\x91rectangle\\x92 all apple watches are made as.\\n\\nI left it on my wrist during a moment of intimacy, however, and (what must have been) the Siri feature audibly said \\x93okay\\x94 at the moment of climax. Now I don\\x92t personally mind the evaluation, as with the fitness app, I have personal goals (standards) to meet. But I feel that just an \\x93okay\\x94 during that particular session was a bit overly critical given the duration and positions taken to achieve this point. Hopefully Apple can improve upon these \\x91evaluations\\x92 or just stick with calorie counting/exercise duration in these situations.\\n\\nAnyways, it\\x92s been a solid device overall. What can I say about an Apple Watch? It\\x92s the best. So many functions, like a piece of jewelry because we can change the cover, the bands etc! I love it! I already had to buy a case to put all my accessories in! Only negative is you have to buy the charging plug separately ?? For the price this should be included. The screen is amazing - large and clear, edge to edge. It integrates really well with my iPhone. I like the different health apps. The sleep tracker isn\\x92t as good as Fitbit. The battery like is just ok - I definitely need to charge daily. The included band works great and stays secure. Overall, I think it is a great watch with lots of apps and lots of possibilities. I barely use 10% of the available functionality. Too soon to tell. I just received it today. I have been wearing an Apple 4 for last couple years so I am excited to this 7. Love my apple watch and price was very competitive. Now i wear it for running and tracking my sleep. Even works w my work security app! Bought this for my son. The had one before ( series 3) and after two years the screen went black. The cost to repair was just about as much as a new one so it was a great birthday gift for him. He loves it, just make sure you purchase the AppleCare. I got this primarily as a heart rate monitor (I was scared off of dedicated, cheaper devices based on various reviews). This is my first smart watch, and I\\x92ve quickly become a fan. Many apps have versions for the Apple Phone (note: some do NOT have apps for the phone). Additional health tracking is cool (breaths/minute while I sleep!). Cool feature to have phone \\x93buzz\\x94 you for alarms are a great way for me to wake up to my morning alarm while allowing my partner to sleep in. Battery life isn\\x92t ideal, but from all I\\x92ve heard, Apple has taken great strides towards improving this with the Series 7. Overall a solid purchase. I\\x92m happy. I love this watch but when it came time to charge it, I was disappointed that Apple did not include the adapter required to attach to the charging cable, which was included. The adapter used with my IPad did not fit so I had to buy an adapter. C\\x92mon, Apple, you need to do better than this. Why make the customer have to buy an adapter? It should be included with the watch. This is my first Apple watch (I just turned 70) and I really love it. I suggest you watch YouTube video\\'s prior to opening the box. There are many helpful hints to get you started and use the many features of the watch. I like changing the watch face to go with whatever I am wearing for the day. I find the heart rate, ECG, Activity log, and fall risk to be helpful and comforting. It\\'s a bit pricey, but if it helps prevent one accident or gives you peace of mind, it is definitely worth it! I do like the watch and do believe it gives fair value but several of the features I was looking forward to are a little lacking.\\nI really wanted it to monitor my activity and work outs but find that it\\x92s just not very accurate at measuring the things I want to keep tracked of. My third Apple Watch. Being older, this gives me more apps to monitor my health. Previous model, Series 3, alerted me I was having AFibs. I was able to show my doctor who immediately referred me to a cardiologist who now how has me on medication to help prevent a stroke from the AFibs! Now I can do an ECK/EKG using my watch and monitor my blood oxygen level. Definitely worth upgrade from the Series 3. I love this watch! I decided to treat myself and I am very glad I did. Just read about it and van be a life saver too. takes your heart rate,ecg, exercises , has a walkie talkie,tells you to stand when you\\'ve been sitting to long etc Not sure why I waited so long to get one but so happy I got this one! Easy to use, easy to read! Great watch and the band actually fits on a large wrist. I don\\x92t regret this purchase. Battery isn\\x92t great but isn\\x92t on my old one or my wife\\x92s Samsung so I\\x92m thinking that\\x92s the norm. Tracks heart rate well and suggest tracking workouts if I forget. I bought Apple Watch for $400.00 & friend bought it the next day for $200. Plus it didn\\x92t come with the electrical cord to plug it into the circle charger. Bummer. Should have included the cord for $400. I like my watch otherwise. Bought it for ECG. At least once a day someone asks is that the new apple watch. I wear it every day, but so many features, I need to figure it all out and that\\'s my fault. Comfortable, need to charge daily. All good and got a decent price. Everything you love about the Apple Watch just larger screen now. I upgraded from my 3 to this model and so glad I did. This is a must have for Apple users\\x85 and if you\\x92re an Android user, well it\\x92s time to make the switch. I love the way the watch looks. Love the stainless steel band, very classy. However I don\\x92t like that it doesn\\x92t stay charged for mor than 16 hrs. Always have to charge it. It doesn\\x92t allow my phone to let me know when calls or texts come in, and I can\\x92t tell on the watch, as it only does a very short vibration. I do love the 45mm face, easy to see. I just wish it would stay charged for longer ?? The size is very good fro people that don\\'t want to carry in the wrist a huge watch that looks like an tablet! I bought this because my employer requires a fitness tracker in order to get a discount for health insurance. I have used a Fitbit device for more than 10 years. I got the 45 mm Apple Watch because I need reading glasses for small print. The fitness step tracker records about 5% less steps than the Fitbit does. If you need reading glasses there is not a whole lot that you can do with the watch face\\x96 \\x96 The font is too small to be usable. It\\x92s easy to click into the apps which are readable with a larger font. The integration with the Apple health app on the cloud is excellent. You can answer calls to your iPhone on your watch which is very helpful if you can\\x92t remember where you put your phone. The audio quality is excellent. It\\x92s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can\\x92t remember where are you left it. The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like. If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen. This happens when you place to watch on your wrist in the morning or remove it during the day. The battery life is just OK. It only charges from an Apple proprietary charger \\x96 \\x96 it charges quickly but the battery only lasts a day or two \\x96 \\x96 much shorter than the Fitbit life. The battery charging cords are not cheap. There is one included in the box. You are probably going to need to purchase a second one. The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter, which is also an expense. I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well. You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse. Since it doesn\\x92t have a charging plug-in it\\x92s pretty waterproof. Like any Apple product it works well, it\\x92s very expensive, and you are semi glad you bought it. The battery lasts about 1 and 1/2 days, I usually charge it while sleeping, so I don\\x92t use the sleep tracking, love how it lets me know if I have a text or phone call, it also helps keep track of my exercise This is my first Apple watch and I\\x92m very impressed. It does everything I need it to do. The band is comfortable and for a watch this size, it\\x92s lightweight. I did order a protective case and glad I did because we spend a lot of time outdoors and I don\\x92t want to worry about smacking it on a tree! I like not having to bring my phone everywhere are go, it\\x92s not as big of a distraction. The sleep tracking works really well helps me keep but tract of my sleeping habits. I really like the fitness app, helps me keep my fitness in check a lot better. I was sitting when my watch said I had a high heart rate . I did indeed got worse , long story short ended up in hospital. , Home doing well now !!!Thank God !!!! thanks I watch . !!!! Love it all! It does it all. Health, sleep tracking, exercise (or not), texts, too much to mention here. Awesome watch. I love my new Apple Watch! My old one was annoying when it went black all the time.\\nMy new watch has some new features but my favorite is I can ALWAYS see what time it is with a glance. This watch is awesome. I bought this for my husband, I already had one. This sync\\x92s very easy with our iPhones. We have had fitbits in the past, but this is by far the best watch. I highly recommend this product. I purchased Series 7 watches for my husband, sister-in-law, and myself. We all love them! We charge them while we\\x92re getting dressed every day and wear them constantly. They were easy to sync with our phones and are fun to use. It\\x92s been a little bit of a learning curve but I like the screen size and the comfort of the band. Band color is also very neutral which is what I wanted. I\\x92m figuring out how to time the charging. I purchased this to qualify for $200 a year back on my insurance premiums, and it works with the program. I have to connect it with Virgin Fitness and Strata, and it works pretty well with both apps, and I\\'ve been pretty happy with it. I was hoping it might have more functionality than email and text notifications, but I like being able to take calls on the watch - the real Inspector Gadget breakthrough was discovering I could converse through the watch. I have to charge it daily, so get a cheap fast charger (if such a thing exists, I\\'m finding most watch chargers are not designed for the 7 series fast capabilities - booo!!!) The EKC feature is cool, but the workout functions are kinda hit or miss. It\\'s probably user error. There are also a lot of useless apps that I\\'ll probably never use. Very impressive watch. Easy to use and learn. Vast array of faces that can be adjusted for personal uses. It works great, but be advised that this version does NOT have the super durable screen that I thought it would. I picked this up without even considering a screen protector because I was under the impression that it had the unscratchable sapphire glass or whatever, but apparently that\\'s only on the non-aluminum body models. My dog pushed my arm into the wall while playing and the screen was scratched on the 4th day of wearing it. I waited a long time to buy this, but I am glad I finally did. Love the features and it\\'s a little big on my wrist, but pretty easy to read. Lots of great apps and perfect for me. Great choice. New series 7 is water resistant to the max! Screen is durable against walls and drops. Battery life is long lasting. I adore this watch, great quality, good battery, easy to use. Best purchase ever and color is so cute Very comfortable to sleep in while tracking your sleep habits. I wear my Apple Watch 7 Series always and the battery life is incredible. When you do charge your watch it is charged at lightning speed. First got it and was pretty impressed. Never had a smart watch before and I liked the sleep tracking, hear beat monitoring, notifications from the phone, calling from watch, etc..\\n\\nbut battery life was horrendous, so much so it affected my iPhone too when connected that it would only last 3 hours for the day when it usually lasted the whole day. When I updated the watch both battery life\\x92s significantly improved, but was upsetting I wasn\\x92t made aware of this beforehand as I had missed some important information from having my phone die so much sooner than anticipated.\\n\\nOnly have owned the watch for a week now so will update again.\\nEdit: battery life is completely normal and watch battery lasts a little over a day and night use One of the main reasons I got the Apple Watch over others is the heart monitor tracking. It works great and my cardiologist asked me to upload the heart rate data before my next appointment. I didn\\'t know it could do that. Super feature. Also I use the feature that always shows what is next on my calendar. I really like this watch! Love this watch - does everything as expected! Moved on from a temperamental Fitbit Versa - love how efficient everything is, and of course how it connects to my iPhone. Great investment in my health! I\\x92m old, I need easy to navigate. I like it but my fit bit did better and was easier. The battery in my \"3\" watch would not stay charged for the day. This watch stays charged for the day plus. I got this as a gift for myself and I love it glad I bought it Love my new Apple Watch! Worst part\\x85 it took a month for it to be delivered. Really like my Apple Watch. Has so many features and I am slowly learning about them. Nice watch to have if you want the features and compatibility with your iPhone. Easy to setup and use. Beautiful functional watch. I love this watch! I can read my text messages, I can answer phone calls and can hear and talk through the watch, there are great apps. Well worth the money! Love all the features. The fall detection. It\\x92s a big step up from my series 3 Me agradó mucho porque es lo que esperaba, el color, el peso y la funcionalidad me son bastante útiles. I love the sleep tracking and alarm feature. I\\x92m able to have a better start to my day since purchasing this watch of pure awesomeness. I never owned an Apple Watch to compare the battery life but so far so good. EXACTLY what she was looking for and performs as expected. Zero complaints. So much better than a series 2 Apple Watch. Battery life is remarkable. Price during Amazo Prime Days was outstanding. I\\x92m so glad I invested in the new iwatch 7 with ECG monitoring. It\\x92s amazing! My heart rate is usually on the low side so I use it to track my heart rate and calories. It works amazingly! So far I love my Apple Watch. Still learning all the possibilities. After unboxing the Apple Watch and setting it up I was amazed at how much bigger this version is than my previous 41MM series 5. The screen is literally huge compared to previous Apple watches that I have owned. The text is very easy to see and set up was incredibly simple. The dark navy color of the watch case and band complement each other perfectly. They are a darker shade of blue almost a deep navy. Wearing the 45 MM sport band instead of the sport solo loop is very comfortable and stays on my wrist through Moderat arm movements. I would highly recommend getting this size of Apple Watch even if you have small to medium sized wrist. My wrist is on the smallish side and the watch fits perfectly, without any discomfort. Overall an excellent watch for sleep tracking and other fitness activities. The Apple Series 7 watch is excellent and does everything it is supposed to do. The case is strong and the glass, although not scratch-proof, resists scratches quite well.\\n\\nWith Apple products, there are many aftermarket products, like watch bands and case and screen protectors. The ubiquity of Apple makes it easy to find whatever additions you want to make the watch truly your own.\\n\\nThe list of available apps is lengthy and the interface and interactivity with an iPhone gives maximum flexibility. Have always doubted that it could be worth the money, but you know what, I really do like it, and it just may be. I like my old Fitbit, but this is really nice with many great features. Ordered for my sons 13th Birthday and he totally loved it. I have become a watch wearer again. Love that I can check my schedules, texts and emails. But to be honest I use it mostly to find my iPhone! (It ends up in the darnedest places.) As expected it doesn\\'t track sleep on a moving tour bus. But love it anyway Bought as a gift and person who it was gifted to loves, loves, it. I love my watch it has so many different things that it can do, track steps, lets me know if I have a message and also will ring and I can answer my phone with it. I bought it so that I could better track workouts along with other health data. Strong pulse sensors\\x85never losses the signal. Wish it tracked deep, REM, and light sleep like other fitness trackers, but it doesn\\x92t. Liked looks,comfort and health monitor apps. Activity app good but battery life not best. Using long distance hiking activity battery did not last full day even with most options closed. Syncs and works great with an iPhone and the price was nice. We had some other non-Apple smart watches that just never worked quite right so we finally caved and bought an Apple Watch. What else can i say. The watch is awesome. Most app are compatible with watch. Battery life is decent being that it is a watch. Two days of battery in my case, use messaging on it. Watch is amazing, but bought it to monitor my swing in golf, but there was not golf app installed. The one inside a calories counter and the same as you will walk or run. This was an early surprise gift for my daughter. She loves it! What I like about this product is that it\\x92s not only paired up with my iPhone ?? but it\\x92s like the watch and iPhone have became almost one and the same connected together. Whenever I have any messages coming or if my phone is charging and I\\x92m busy, it always sends me an alert and notification, or if I\\x92m playing my music, it allows me to pause and rewind back as well. And as for the battery life, it seems perfectly fair and easy to use. Definitely would recollection it! ?? Does this watch track sleep? I thought it did, but I\\x92m used to how my Fitbit Versa 2 tracked my sleep and I can not figure out how this Apple Watch could do something like that! If you know, please reply and let me know. And I\\x92m not talking about adding an additional app where you have to pay for all the features and/or a subscription. Besides having to charge the watch just about every day and not being able to figure out how to track my sleep, the watch it great. I\\x92ve never had an Apple Watch before so this was mostly a great purchase. It\\x92s a great purchase! It helps you get your sleep on track, exercise, reminders, and messages on the go! There are workout goals that you can complete in which helps you earn medals. This has helped me become more consistent in developing a healthier plan for myself! It\\x92s a great watch. It charges from dead to fully charged in one hour. I put a case on it so it doesn\\x92t scratch. I also like how there\\x92s a water eject button. About battery life: turn off the always on display, this will allow the screen to automatically come on when you turn your wrist to look at the watch. With the AOD off, the watch will drain about 2% per hour with light use. When I leave for work at 6am and return at 5:30pm my watch is at 80%. This is not with heavy use, about 2.5 hrs of the time it is controlling GPS on my phone and music playing via bluetooth.\\n\\nAs for not including a brick for the USB charger, if you own an iPhone you should have a brick anyway, so not a big deal. Plus these days, if you got a brick for everything you would need multiple power strips for them. Just buy a USB brick that has multiple outlets so you can charge your phone, watch, laptop, tablet, and all the other things that take USB-C. Really one of the best smart watch in the market. Coming from LTE S4 this GPS S7 is brilliant and I don\\x92t even have to worry for coming phone calls or music. With 32GB is enough to load all the music want and works very smoothly. This fitness tracker has encouraged me to get farther into living an active, healthy lifestyle. The prime day price was unheard of, I\\x92m happy I was able to score that good of a deal. I love the watches and what they do I love my Apple Watch!! Great Prime Day price and quick shipping I have been thinking about the Apple Watch for quite a while, had a colonoscopy a year ago and learned that my AFIB had returned. Long story short, I had a cardio version and was put on a beta blocker which worked well for about 6 days. Then my heart would kick back into AFIB for a little while, then the beta blocker would try to convert back to sinus rythym, in doing so, my heart would do what they call \\'conversion pauses\\', only mine would pause to the point of nearly passing out. I happened to catch one of the worst pauses that lasted 8.7 seconds. I was using my Apple Watch in the ECG mode to check AFIB, at the time. My heart was pausing multiple times. Sent the recordings to my heart dr. and he took me off the beta blocker for now. I will go back on those after I get my pacemaker the end of the month. If it had not been for the watch and the ability to do the ECGs, I would have not known what was going on and would have thought it to be common under the circumstances. So, I think the watch may have saved my life, by helping to figure out the pauses, which kept getting worse. Thanks to Apple, I\\'m still here to write about it. Sure something else may have worked just as well, but this is what worked for me. It saved me having to wear a monitor for weeks at the very least. Wife loves the watch but not the band. I\\x92m glad I waited for Prime Day and got it cheaper than through other retailers. Although with Prime Day you can\\x92t add Apple Care but I was able to add it through Apple after the fact. I\\x92m still getting used to it but it\\x92s nice to not always need my phone. I do question the battery life though as it doesn\\x92t seem to last the amount of hours they claim. Have enjoyed the watch and it\\x92s capabilities but wish the battery had a longer lifetime between charges. Had a Fitbit prior to this and it lasted 6/7 days between charges. This watch is amazing! Love the faces and all that it can do! Health apps are great! Nothing to dislike about this Apple Watch 7. Best Watch I\\x92ve ever owned. Just the fact that you can change bands and tailored it to your style alone beats out the comparison. I\\x92m really loving my Apple Watch & all the cool things it does. Activity tracking is inspiring; Mindfulness is helping me with Yoga; seeing iPhone notifications is helpful.\\nI do not like that I must charge it daily & you can\\x92t do it overnight if you want sleep tracking! In any case, soon I wouldn\\x92t be able to live without it???? I got this watch as a B-day present for my wife. The primary reason was fitness tracking and mostly for the heart rate feature when she\\'s on her bike. The screen is big and easy for her to see at a glance. The set up seemed to be easy even for her as she is not tech savvy. Can\\'t figure out the sleep tracker however. Overall, I think she likes it or she acts like she likes it.\\nCons: It AIN\\'T CHEAP. Battery life is short. She opened it to discover the power cord was missing which means that it had previously been opened. That was a hassle trying to figure out what to do. Talked to Amazon about it and they offered me $40 to go drive all over creation and find a way to charge it. The wrist band provided is quite literally, a joke. Order a cheap-o one piece when you order the watch. The problem is that it very easily pops open and the watch falls to the ground just like that, a dozen times a day and sometimes you don\\'t realize it has come off. So that makes it super easy to lose. Really really stupid and poor design and they should be ashamed. Then......what we ordered was the Apple Series 7 (GPS) Brand new not reconditioned. What we got was the Apple Series 7 (GPS and Cellular) which is a much more expensive watch but we got it for the GPS only price. So again that confirms that the packaging was opened up and things were removed and switched OR it means that we got a reconditioned watch. THAT would really piss me off but I can\\'t confirm it. All it all, it is decent, she likes it and we are moving forward with life. ~Patrick J, Fruita, Colorado The battery life is excellent as long as you limit the always on feature. Durable and exceptionally advanced. Well worth it. Awesome technology features. I didn\\x92t get the cellular version since it connects to my iPhone capabilities and mirrors the call and text on my iPhone as long as the iPhone is within range. Love the size of the screen. The only negative thing I can say it has is battery life. Used to have a fit bit and battery lasted longer, almost a week. Other than that, everything works great. I did purchased a case for screen to protect it from being scratched. It does come with two bands, a medium and a large, comes with charger but not charger box so you will need to buy a C charging box for it, fits any generic brand box. Got mine at Walmart for under $11 You get what you expect. It\\x92s an apple device. Quality. Reliability. Smoothness. Only downside is the battery. Obviously it\\x92s going to be less in the 41mm. You\\x92ll have to charge it every night or morning if you plan on using it through your the day. Looks sleek too It\\'s far more beautiful in person than shown here. I bought a $15 black chain and it\\'s beautiful: perfect for me. I\\'ve always been fascinated by watches but never owned one I enjoyed so much. Also, my watch tells me, accurately, my Oxygen level. Some folks have claimed it\\'s inaccurate, but it\\'s correct the way I use it, which I will explain here. Please note: I\\'ve compared it to my oximeter which is absolutely accurate compared to one of the world\\'s largest hospitals oxygen reporting machines, and it\\'s inline with both.\\n\\nAt sleep my oxygen goes down, so it\\'s accuracy is imperative to me. I wear it on my left wrist slightly further away from my hands. I use my hands a lot playing guitar, doing dishes, typing.\\n\\nThe ECC is fascinating, but I\\'m blessed to not have need of it, at this point.\\n\\nI like the awards and motivational achievement things.\\n\\nI love how it finds my phone, my daughter\\'s phone and wife\\'s phone.\\n\\nThe display is fantastic. Beautiful. The faces are wonderful.\\n\\nThe price dropped dramatically and I nearly sent it back. I didn\\'t because I love the watch. The original band it came with really is awful.\\n\\nI love the way it charges with a magnetic no plug charger. It charges very fast. I have to charge it once a day.\\n\\nThe speaker and mic are okay. They work, although I feel funny talking into my watch. Futuristic in a retro way.\\n\\nThe band it comes with did not work for me at all. It has two sizes, but it appears flimsy and keeps falling off. On the plus side it fell many times, and I nearly returned it for that, but it did not break, so I did not. Watch bands are plentiful and all are better than the OEM.\\n\\nDoes not take blood pressure, as far as I can tell. That\\'s about all it doesn\\'t do.\\n\\nI\\'m not yet certain about subscribing to the apple watch thing. I have a 3 month trial period before I will decide. So far I haven\\'t needed that aspect of it. I suppose if I were to work out on my own it would be very good.\\n\\nGreat watch -- beautiful, appears to be water proof. Strong. Great display. So long as it lasts I\\'m very happy. Replace the OEM band immediately. It\\'s been my experience that my Apple products last a long time.\\n\\nMy daughter and wife both want one. Works great, love sleep tracker. I really like the watch. Love this watch very functional Got it a nice price. The watch is great. I probably missed it in the listing but, no power adapter came with the watch. It requires a power adapter that receives usb C. I was so excited to get my watch then Couldn\\x92t use it for 24 hours until I ordered and received the power adapter. I have a power adapter now and love the watch. Potential purchasers make sure you order a power adapter with your watch. And now I love it! Apple watch is perfect for keeping track of your fitness. It has a good amount of modes and features that are specific to different workouts. The U.I had built in features like \\x93fitness rings\\x94 and \\x93Achievements\\x94 to keep you motivated towards completing your daily workouts.\\n\\nIt has a built-in heart rate monitor. It also keeps track of your calories burned (which is the primary reason for my purchase)\\n\\nThere are many apple watch versions of the apps that are on the AppStore. This is useful because you can keep track of app specific features with ease.\\n\\nSetup was extremely quick and easy. Opening the packaging actually takes more time than the setup itself! Setup and pairing consist of you pointing your phone\\x92s camera at a fancy QR code. Then the rest is automatically done by your phone.\\n\\nThe watch comes with two adjustable bands. It comes with a short band and a long band. The charger is usb-c to magnet. (which is included, though it\\x92s only the cable. Not the power brick\\x85)\\n\\nThe battery life on the apple watch is pretty good, i find myself having to stick it on the charger once every 2-3 days. It also charges relatively quick which is nice.\\n\\nOverall, i\\x92d like to recommend this watch to people who are working on staying fit, or people who simply want to spend less time on their phones but still receive their phone notifications in a less distracting manner. It works really good and I haven\\x92t had any problems with so far I love Apple products this is my third watch, my first one was destroyed in a bicycle accident. My series 3 is still good but can no longer be updated, so I opted for the Series 7. Could not be happier.. This watch has the features for heart beats per minute, blood oxygen levels and ECG. These are great for heart issues. Also the phone answering capability is really helpful. I originally was hesitant to purchase this Apple Watch on Amazon, however it was on sale during Prime days. Came quickly as always from Amazon and was in the original Apple packaging. Very happy to have this latest Apple Watch at a discounted price. Everything is great about this version, but battery live. Why not better capacity batteries after 7 generations of this product This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it! A good true item. Most pleased with watch If you have an older watch then you\\x92ll definitely notice the differences fast. I upgraded from the 4 to this one. I must say I\\x92m impressed. I would consider it worth it if you\\x92re looking to upgrade. Battery life is wayyyy better. Text keyboard is my fav upgrade I kept going back and forth as to whether I should order this watch and was hesitant to order in online, rather than go into and Apple dealer. I am in LOVE with this watch and wish I had pulled the trigger earlier. It is super user-friendly and has so many functions that are easy to learn to use. It pairs up with my Peloton and shows me my heart rate and automatically adds my workout to my rings. This totally motivates me to workout each day as you add other people with Apple watches to share your workout and it notifies you when one of your friends worked out. It encourages you to keep moving and gives you praise for closing your rings each day. The bands are easy to change and the battery stays charged all day and then charges pretty quickly on the charger that is sold separately. If mine broke tomorrow, I would order another one with no hesitation. Great for use with my phone. I can do just about everything I do with phone alone. It\\x92s like a phone on my wrist. I\\x92ve had 4 - fitbits, the 4th stopped working, customer service didn\\x92t help - so I moved to Apple. Apple doesn\\x92t have as nice of sleep tracking, however, Apple calls 911 if you fall I love the screen it just looks great and the fitness tracking is great I love closing my rings and the 45mm is a great size My last iPhone was the 5s. Since then I\\'ve been die hard Samsung and fell in love with the Note series, with the Note 9 being my most recent Samsung phone. I\\'d bought a Gear S3 and it was an awesome watch but after switching to an iPhone 12 Pro Max, I discovered that the two didn\\'t work so well together. Some functions are fine but I wanted to be able to respond to texts and phone calls from my watch if necessary and couldn\\'t with the Samsung watch/iphone combination.\\n\\nAfter doing a lot of research I decided I wanted the latest Apple watch available. I found this one, which was used and described as being in \"good\" condition. If it has been used, however, I can\\'t tell because there are no scratches or other outward signs of use on it. It even came in Apple watch packaging with the wireless watch charger.\\n\\nBattery life seems to be good so far although I\\'ve turned off the always on display. If I\\'m not looking at it, I don\\'t need it to be on and if I do look at it, the display comes on so in my opinion anything beyond that is a waste of battery life. I like the ekg and blood oxygen functions. Changing faces, editing/adding/removing \"complications\" from the home screen is easy. Syncing the watch to my phone was as easy as pointing my phone\\'s camera at the watch face. One of the best things about it is how seamlessly everything flows together in the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\nI\\'m sure there will be minor annoyances or things I don\\'t like later on down the road but as of now, it\\'s quite a few notches above my old Gear watch and a welcome and useful addition to my phone. I got this watch in a deal. I think o made a good decision. It arrived with a good packaging and good shape. I wear it all the time and track my workout. I can also make and receive calls and see all the notifications. Only complaint is the battery life isn\\x92t that good but other than that solid so far I love this watch!! I waited patiently for this color to become available on Prime Days. Worth the \\x93watch\\x94! The series 7 is so much better than the 3 for reading and using it for more applications. Going to a 41mm made all the difference from the 38 on my series 3. The commercials like to say this watch (Apple Watch 7) is the most scratch proof of the watches. I had mine less than 2 months, big scratch down the middle. I\\x92m disabled and don\\x92t leave the house often. I only wear when I go out. It got scratched. So don\\x92t believe the hype it\\x92s scratch proof. There are many more features on the Apple Watch than a Fitbit. The older I get the more I appreciate the health tracking options. Like everything except the band. I might pre fee a cloth and velcro. May look for one of those but not a deal breaker I set up my watch and found out that a full charge lasted me less than SIX HOURS. I knew there was no way this was right.\\n\\nIf you are having issues like this, make sure you:\\n1. Update the watch\\n2. Unpair and reset the watch\\n3. Pair again.\\n\\nThis helped me to fix whatever issue the watch was having, and now the battery life is fantastic. Maybe there was an error when I first paired it?\\n\\nEverything else is as advertised, great watch. The wristband that came with it is hard to put on your wrist, other than that I Love my apple watch! Bought a new stretchy band, love the fact you can buy all kinds and colors of wristbands at a reasonable price. I love the heart app and like that the face stays on constantly unlike older models. Lots of new apps for this mod. Love my watch! Helps me to move more and to keep up with my health readings. Also I can answer phone calls and messages without looking for my phone muy bonito reloje y perfecto para mi esposa Everything works fine Gave it to my wife and she loved it. Although her last Apple Watch one was pink the silver is still pretty nice. I love my Apple Watch 7, but I can\\x92t sleep with it because the battery is of short duration, so I charge in the night. I would love to track my sleep (I have sleep apnea, so it would be very helpful if I can track my sleep ) Purchased used through Amazon warehouse. Save a few hundred and found no issues. However it did not qualify for Apple care because of the original purchase date. I opened an Apple Care support and brought it into the Apple Store to run their diagnostics and verifications. A few hours later I was able to purchase Apple Care for this device. Technically, paying for extended warranty is not required but I want to protect my purchase. I\\x92m really enjoying learning the capabilities of the watch. It\\x92s definitely a life enhancer.\\nMy only wish is for a printed manual that I could leaf through. Love it My son has been trying for quite some time to get me to get one; I finally agreed. Boy, was he correct! The features are amazing, I love the features! Highly recommend!! Great product Good watch Love it. Can\\'t really say how the watch is since unaware to me, the Block (USB-C ) as I\\'m now seeing it called is not included. Honestly charge a bit more to begin with and include it. Wouldn\\'t you think when the description says charging cord included it would also have the plug connection. Had to wait 2 more days to get that before I could start to set it up and see how everything works. It arrived today and now it\\'s almost finished charging, so hopefully all will go smoothly now. Fingers crossed! Bought this to track my health, and keep me focused. Perfect for work when you cannot have your phone out. I love the watch. Comfortable on my wrist, fits well. Great for fitness tracking as well as time date etc. etc. This is my third watch...all have performed very well. Only upgraded after 2+ years of use...they only get better... Fantastic I wasn\\x92t sure what to expect when I purchased this watch but I am impressed with all it can do. Great It\\x92s absolutely worth the money, especially when you can get it for way less on Amazon. I got the product red, it stands out very well. People say that the 45mm is too big for a small wrist, but mine fits great on my somewhat small wrists. The bigger screen will come in handy. It\\x92s easier to type on or simply just using calculator app. I use nearly all the features. The best, I\\'m a senior and I fell down. My watched buzzed on my wrist and asked if I needed an SOS! Perfect and what I bought this watch for. I was fine. I also use the sleep and exercise which keeps track of everything. Love it! Nice display. Great watch. Like the increase in size from the series3 and the bands still are interchangeable. It\\x92s an Apple Watch. It\\x92s good, will continue to be good. Great price, can\\x92t say enough good things about it. Well doesn\\'t the time say it all, its a great product just wish my wife would be ok with it, she works for Samung and hates apple. I personally like both Samsung and Apple Accurate and nice Only reason it doesn\\x92t have 5 stars is because I didn\\x92t receive the correct band color. I ordered the one with the midnight band and received the abyss blue instead. Watch works perfectly I couldn\\x92t be happier with it just that one small issue. I believed that since it did not come directly from Apple it was fake or it would not serve well. BUT IT IS TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE, IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME, IT IS SUPER COMFORTABLE, QUALITY AND MOST OF ALL DURABLE I\\'ve been eyeing out for the right deal, and I found that it was the time that I should purchase an Apple Watch. Though, it\\'s a bummer that the power brick did not come with this watch, given the price point that it already is. I don\\'t know why Apple says there are trying to help the environment by limiting these important features when we have to pay again, just to realize there is no power brick in the box.\\n\\nAnother downside is that if your want to stream music from your Apple Watch, from a third-party streaming service such as Spotify, it WON\\'T work. You will need to buy the cellular version if you want to stream music from your watch. Otherwise, this regular watch will only act as a remote for your iPhone.\\n\\nAnyways, on the bright side, this watch helps me stay active and reminds me to get up once in a while. So, I\\'ve been using this watch for the minimum, such as reading emails, writing reminders, walking, sleep tracking, and so on. I ordered 3 apple watches on prime day. I have heard horror stories of people never receiving their items and just empty boxes. I never though this would happen to me. 2/3 apple watches were in their boxes with charges and the wrist bands. The third box was just a part of the band. Thank god I called product services to let them know. They took care of my issue immediately and were patient with me. I was so worried and honestly a little ticked off that my item was missing. But thankfully everything is working on and a replacement is otw. Purchased for my husband. He had previously owned several Fitbit trackers. Loves his Apple Watch with all its apps Got a good deal on Prime Day so I thought I\\x92d try it. Took a bit to get the face I liked. Battery life is less than I expected. Less than 2 days. Little by little I\\x92m figuring out how to use. Thank goodness for YouTube videos because it came with very little instructions. Sleep tracking gives different info than my Fitbit did. Still learning. Haven\\x92t had it too long. ?? I enjoy wearing my Apple watch series 7.\\nOne thing I believe it can be improved is it\\x92s heart rate sensor and accuracy.\\n\\nNo matter how I wear the Apple watch or which hand I put it on, It takes a few minutes for the heart rate to be displayed. The more concerning part is at the high intensity stage of my workout like an uphill run, the heart rate put out by my applet watch is consistently significantly lower than that measured by my Fitbit Versa or ionic watch.\\nThe attached photos show the comparison between my Apple Watch series 7 and my Fitbit Versa 2 on the same outdoor run I like the new screen way bigger than my 3. I really like the stay on display too I\\x92m very happy!! treated myself Always wanted one. I so do not regret this purchase. Now an Apple Watch user for life! I especially like the ecg, oxygen sensor and fall detector. I also appreciate the long battery life it has. I love everything about this watch except the battery life. I have changed the setting to not have the screen on constantly and I even put it in theater mode often to save on battery and it still doesn\\x92t last a full 24 hrs. It has about a third of the battery life that my series 3 did. The charger also doesn\\x92t have a usb end like most other Apple devices and doesn\\x92t come with a charging block. If Apple is going to change it up again, they should include the block. I just use the charger from my old watch since all my blocks are usb.\\nI\\x92ve worn it in the pool and it still works great, so it\\x92s actually waterproof. Cellular works with no problems. The EKG and oxygen levels are a nice addition.\\nYou can set it to alert 911 if you fall but I\\x92ve turned it off because it had called 911 twice on me. Once while washing dishes and once while changing the band. My heart doctor suggested I buy an Applewatch after having a couple of procedures. Said heart apps were great way to monitor heart activity. He was right. The blood oxygen and ECG apps are easy to use and accurate. Heart Rate app keeps me updated on what my heart is doing and gives me the option to send results to my doctor. I like the fact that I can take phone calls from nearby cell phone and receive e-mails and text. Didn.t have plans or desire to buy a Apple watch but glad I did. This was a great gift. She loves it. She wears it all the time. If battery was longer, would give 5 stars Excelente equipo, Rápido, ágil pantalla muy buena resolución simplemente excelente muy contento; no le doy 5 es por no incluir el adaptador, si que son misersbles. El vendor se lleva 5 estrellas, eficiente rapido y equipos de calidad gracias. I love that it has full screen display! Makes it seem so much larger than the series 3. My family got this for my mom and she loves it. Everything works great. This is the nicest smart watch I ever owned, it\\x92s amazing how accurate the watch is for tracking my heart, breath, and sleeping. I bought 41mm apple watch till now as for my experience it is pretty good in all prospective but battery life is not much satisfactory. Sleep tracking is also not much accurate or satisfactory Excellent watch. Love all the health stuff. Many options to make it your own style. Speakers low. Battery life only @ a day. Quick charge. Does not come with special adapter for charging. Bought extra \\x93brick\\x94 through Apple on Amazon. I love it and more that I got the discount on a prime day, the big difference with the series three that I have before, flatter and the screen is more significant, more space to see everything on your watch I got this for the ECG heart app. Really helps w/ tracking my issues. Got it in Prime day at a great buy !! Love it ! Great watch. Super stylish and tracks all I need. You do have to charge it every other evening so be prepared for that. Plus it needs a unique charger. Me encanto el precio en descuento en ese momento nunca desaprovechar una oferta Battery life is great all tracking features have been an asset great Apple product I just upgraded from a 1st gen Apple Watch to Series 7. WOW! What an improvement! The heartbeat, blood H2O, and ECG apps are simply amazing features. Also, I love the new colors, improved face templates, and the band has been improved. Really happy with the purchase. I like the activity tracker and text messages right to my watch All this technology right on my wrist. Love it. Don\\x92t remember how I ever did without it. At a glance access to time, temperature, heart rate, date, and most importantly, the current price of Tesla stock. Easy to track exercising. First and foremost -- Be aware the the less expensive aluminum models do NOT have sapphire glass, instead they have a relatively soft \"ion strengthened glass\" that scratches and scuffs incredibly easy from even the most incidental contact. It\\'s unacceptable IMO for a smartwatch that retails over $400 (which the 45 does). If I ever get another Apple Watch, it will 100% be on the higher end casings that actually have sapphire glass. Friends have stainless steel and their watches are 100% scratch free after a year while my aluminum model is already scuffed and looks second hand after 2 months. In marketing and descriptions from Apple it reads like all models have the sapphire glass unless you read the fine print, this is just a PSA for those considering the aluminum.\\n\\nAs for the Apple Watch on its own merits, I love it. The sleep tracking is basically non-existent and the battery needs to be charged every day, but the other functions and the user experience are spectacular. I just can\\'t wholeheartedly recommend the aluminum models for the average person to keep on their wrist day after day as their main watch, it scuffs just by living. Love the watch using it to track my activities.\\nRecommend this watch Fitbit to Apple. Difficult to program & understand. Have to charge every night so I don\\'t get important vitals at night. Fitbit battery last 4-5 days! I love everything about this watch except for the battery life. I love that their are so many apps on it. Great watch!! Girlfriend loves it, says it\\x92s even better than her previous model Very nice watch keeps track of your heartbeat blood pressure Exactly what I expected from an I watch by apple So far, works great. No problems with an Apple watch.. Like the bright red color This is a fantastic watch. I was hesitant about getting one of these figuring I would destroy it as it big and my watches usually get beat up. I found a heavy duty watch band an that seems to have helped. This has more features than I will use. I like the Navigation and how it syncs up to my phone. The heart monitoring apps are nice too and the now playing app that allows me to control the phone and ear pods. I wish the compass would work with the metal watch case but I will have to remove it if I need to use the compass. The only thing I don\\x92t care for is the battery life. I usually have to change it every night. If I am out camping where I need the compass and navigation having to change it nightly will be an issue. The keyboard is tiny but they made an effort to put one on there. As usual, it\\'s an overpriced Apple product. It works as advertised. However, it has some minor glitches, such as keeping track of heart rate. Sometimes, it works, sometimes it gives wrong numbers when checking heart rate. This particular watch was a present to my daughter. I do prefer Android based watches as the choice of watches is much better than Apple watches. Anniversary present to my husband. He loved it. Got this watch to answer phone calls and be able to show that indeed did read. The bonus is the surprising keyboard that is a step up from active two from Samsung. The other features including being able to do much more. It\\x92s been several years but hoping watch technology keep on improving. I like to be able to take phone calls on it. I love this watch, it is everything I expected it to be. Great watch. Does everything I need it to do! The case I have on it doesn\\x92t allow me to type texts very well-but that\\x92s not the watches fault. I definitely recommend Love this. Wear it all the time. Love the Apple Watch, I have to charge it daily even when it not mirroring my IPhone. picked up for wife as she broke her 5 (it had a great run)\\n\\nloves it. way more screen for the same size (shes very little)\\n\\ngreat battery life Already had a series 4 for three years before breaking it. This is the newest in the series and the always on display does make this a better product for me.\\n\\nThere are other additional features like better battery life, but this is still needing to be charged once a day. The fast charging is nice though because as long as I charge it while I get ready in the morning, it will always make it through the day.\\n\\nIf you have a series 3 or earlier, this is a worthwhile upgrade. If you\\x92re series 4 or later, just wait until yours is broken. I love my new watch it\\x92s an upgrade from\\nI watch 5. Oxygen level keeps me informed if too low. Battery life is great ! Charging is faster too ! Great Buy!\\nThank you Amazon! Being disabled senior, this is my life line. If I fall I get help. I can call anyone. And great for reminders. I love my watch every senior should have one. I feel safer. Great watch at a great price. Amazing I watch\\x85 just loved it ?? Helps keep track of my exercise. Expected battery life to be longer Love this watch and as the title says, best purchase ever! My husband loves his watch. I have an older version that he bought me a few years ago. He has never had an Apple Watch and he loves it. And at a discounted price it is great. The updated heart monitor is wonderful and very easy to read. Great watch to wear daily. Battery does not hold as much of a charge as my series 4 model in the beginning but still has the great looks as the Apple series 4. Great addition to iPhone if like myself can not have your phone on you while at work. The Apple Watch solves many of these challenges. Great to find this version of the Apple Watch at a lower price! I love it. If my phone isn\\x92t in my hand then I still know I have messages or can answer a call with the watch. Great little gadget This watch does everything you want or need to do. I wear it while paddling on the dragon boat and have no issues with monitoring or recording exercise. The husband is Happy with it Love some of the extra features on the watch. Really enjoying learning all it has to offer me! Bought this for my wife. She loves it! This is my third apple watch, as features are added I am enticed to upgrade. Pass the old ones to my kids who love them as well. \\x95 Better than 24 hour battery with light use.\\n\\x95 Cardiac functions (O2, EKG and BPM) are handy\\n\\x95 Always on display!!\\n\\nPhoto with Barton NATO strap Received it, mail lady delivered to wrong box. Very nice watch, easy to setup! This is my 2nd Apple Watch and I love it!!!\\nIt was time to upgrade and I found this on sale on prime day and jumped!! Very useful! Just started using the Fitness+ app. Easy to text and answer and end phone calls. Connects with AirPod pros. Waterproof, swim-proof! Definitely worth the money. The battery life and fast charging is implicit! My cardiologist recommended me to get this watch to help monitor my AFib. I\\x92ve had it a week now and I\\x92m still learning things about it\\x85\\nMy only complaint is it doesn\\x92t come with the \\x93brick\\x94 to plug your charger into There is only one advantage to Fitbit, battery life. Everything else, this is far superior and a greater value. Worked flawlessly from day 1. It feels very light when you wear it on your hand. It has a stylish appearance and enough functions. I like it very much. Received fast and very nice new series 7 You get a summary for each day and a running average on the app. I\\x92m 81 and it certainly nice to have something that keeps track of all that information! The Apple Watch is user friendly, great for activity tracking, and a great way to stay connected without constantly having a phone in hand! A gift from my husband. While I don\\x92t approve of spending that much money on a watch it\\x92s been nice to have. My only complaint is that it has to be charged nightly or it\\x92ll die the next day. I did drop it on concrete and it didn\\x92t scratch or crack so that\\x92s a plus! I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife. She loves it. She doesn\\'t have to constantly be looking at her cell phone for notifications, they come to her phone. She loves the Health Tracker App for daily excersize and activities. I\\x92ve always wanted one Love the Apple Watch ?? best product that I have perched this year. Only flaw is the batterie doesn\\x92t last more than one day, other than that super easy to use, very convenient apps love this product\\x85..! Thanks to reading the reviews I was prepared. You have make an extra purchase for the connector to charge the watch. The battery life is the worst but the watch is exceptional. Otherwise Loving it so far. Me gusta la carga rápida y la amplitud de su pantalla, vengo de tener el Watch 4 y la experiencia es superior. Another great product by Apple. This watch is fantastic for health conscious. This actually promotes health & encourages to increase physical activities. I\\x92ve had the series 3 for four years. It was time to upgrade. Apple makes an excellent product and during Amazon Prime specials I purchased one There is no comparison to the Apple Watch for quality. Love it! Got this on amazon day! Good deal! Saved me when my iPhone\\x92s screen didn\\x92t work. Was able to use it to call/txt etc. Battery can last two days !!! Very easy to use but idk if it is comfortable for sleeping it\\x92s pretty bulky. Amazing product. Everything! I like it as a watch & phone! My son wanted me to have it for my health & safety! Everyday use I don\\x92t wear it to bed. All else I like except for the battery life.\\nNeeds to be charged every evening. Actualizando mi nuevo reloj y junto a él mi viejo series 5. Aun no pruebo a tope el rendimiento de la batería pero traeré una actualización pronto. Excelente reloj aunque es poca la diferencia física con respeto al cambio del 5 al 7 I kept going back and forth on either the Apple Watch or the new Fitbit. What came down to it was the Apple Watch did not require me to have a monthly subscription to use all its health/fitness tracking services and I have all apple products so it links up to all my\\nelectronics.\\nOnly down side to using all the health and fitness monitoring is I have to charge it daily. Good thing it charges super fast.\\nI take it off in the morning as I get ready for the day let it charge and then put it on before My day starts.\\nI love it and understand why so many people said I should get one. I don\\x92t regret it. Also glad I bought the screen protector it\\x92s helped on multiple occasions!!! The band color is \\x93starlight\\x94 sounds like a ehite color. In addition the band appears to be white in picture. It is in fact tan-beige. I needed white so now I need to order an extra band. This is a great watch, it does everything, the battery life is limited, can\\'t go for two day, if it is not recharged over night will run out of power. I still love it. Update: 4 weeks later, the errors have not reoccurred??\\nOnly had this New watch a few days and for no reason my customized Home Screen icons changed all at the same time;\\nBatter level changed to heart rate.\\nTotal daily step count changed to world clock.\\nJellyfish background changed to generic clock face.\\nYes, battery was charged & never came close to fully drained. This new watch is better all around, battery life, glass screen apps. A great Apple Watch at a good price. I was shocked at how terrible the battery life is especially compared to my Garmin Fenix. I think it\\x92s ridiculous that the watch has to be charged every single day. Obviously charging it overnight would be the easiest thing to do but then you miss out on the sleep tracking.\\n\\nThat said now that I have an iPhone I do prefer how this watch interacts with the phone compared to my Garmin. Awesome technology! This watch can do it all. Love it so much. Love that you spend less time checking your phone. And it encourages you to move more and pushes you to keep reaching for goals. Really recommend anyone to get a watch that tracks your movements. Easy to use. I\\x92m not very tech savvy The new health features available only in this latest series seven convinced me to upgrade from an earlier version. WatchOS upgrades are also very good. I\\'ve also found battery life to be better than my older version. Nothing competes with an Apple Watch -- it is the best by far. Got it in the prime day sale. 330$ for series 7 45 mm watch is a steal of a deal. Perfect! Easy to set up, apps are great and the cellular option is awesome for long runs so you don\\x92t have to lug your phone around. 41mm size is great for most people. Overall very happy Awesome product I like it. Good UI and connectivity with my phone and on its own. Apple taking over the world. I like that it vibrates on my wrist when I receive a call and that I can see the time in daylight. I\\x92m slowly learning how to do it all. Like Apple Watch better than my Fitbit but both are good. It works great! My last one was good but this one is better Very good watch and quality is amazing My husband lost his watch on vacation so got this one. It\\x92s very nice and has cool features I mainly got it for her for the sleep tracking but she uses it monitor health and steps per day This Apple Watch is great. Perfect for my needs Dis mf lit as hell but tbh it\\x92s pretty useless but I like the way it looks Everything works great does everything it says I love it! I went from fitbit to this watch. Big, big difference of course. I use the wallet, exercise, messages features. I even did maps. The navigation was a little obnoxious when it came to telling me to turn in a certain direction but I won\\x92t have an excuse to miss a turn now. Love it! Mostly used with health apps . Also convenient to see important message without holding phone . This watch is very clear, fast, updated, and a great overall watch! But the battery life blows. I\\x92ll start wearing it at 8am and it\\x92ll be dead by 6pm. I\\x92ve turned off apps, notifications, and whatever else and it still blows. Even wearing it overnight on sleep mode it\\x92s like almost dead in the morning If you have model 6 Apple Watch there are very few reasons to upgrade. I only upgraded mine because to model 7 because my previous watch fell on tile and cracked the screen. Otherwise, it\\'s a good overpriced Apple product well ahead of any competition, not much to add here. Worked right out of the package and easy set up. The battery life is just short. I love this watch many great features I went from a 3 to this 7 big different and great deal Awesome watch, but would recommend to get a case for it. Other than that love it! My Mom debated about upgrading her iWatch since the 7 came out. When I saw Prime Day had such an amazing deal on it, I told her. She had me buy it for her asap! It arrived 3 days later and she is loving it! No one else could touch that price and she is so happy so has it now. So thanks Amazon! my only dislike is the difficulty of texting on the watch..I need to use siri Did not know if I would like it but now I wear it every day. Love it! Upgraded from a Series 3 Apple watch and very happy with the new watch and it\\'s capabilities. I don\\x92t like that without an adapter I cannot charge my watch Bought this watch for my wife\\x92s birthday,,,, she absolutely loves it! I bout this watch on prime day for an outstanding deal. The next day I had to go to the phone store and they were charging double of what I paid. The watch is amazing. I am not able to have my phone at work, so this watch allows my kids to always be in contact with me. I really enjoy the fitness tracker and use it to track my workouts There are some important features expected for the money. I was expecting to get more monitoring functions to provide complete vital but simple data for immediate emergency evaluation by first responders, doctors, specialist and primary physician avoiding waste of time that saves more lives especially to weak, elderly with vulnerable, delicate, complicated and worsening health conditions for the pice paid to this device.\\nA new and updated apple iPhone was also purchased to achieve the full the limited functionality and incomplete data\\x92s.\\nThe unexpected expenses superseded the maximum amount budgeted amount. Upgraded to the 7 from the 3 and I am so impressed and pleased with these upgrades. As someone that suffers from tachycardia and vertigo frequently I love how I can keep track of my o2 sat and ecg. It alerts me to high heart rates and if I fall from my vertigo I feel better knowing that it can send an emergency alert if I need it. The face display is way bigger than the 3 and I love it. Storage is also way bigger and I can download a lot more apps. battery life is great and charging is fast. I am so happy I finally got the series 7, best investment and I use it everyday. This new Apple Watch is outstanding. The features and health monitoring is amazing. It does everything I need it to do. As a diabetic it alerts me for high/low blood sugars with the App and vibrates to do this. Very important for me. Great buy So happy I upgraded my Apple Watch! Everything I hoped it would be! I fell in yard and I was able to call for help right away. Excellent buy. Todo bien: tamaño, funciones, estética. Batería es otro tema. Pero en general insuperable. I love being able to track my steps, especially when I go on my outside walks! I can check my texts and notifications! I wish the battery life was longer. I\\x92m still trying to figure out how all of the different functions work. ?? Very attractive blue watch. Like it a lot more then my Apple 4 watch Love this watch. Makes me keeping track of health issues very painless. I purchased the watch to pair it with my iPhone and quite honestly, very happy I did. Muy buen equipo I like it. I like it a lot. Not nearly as cumbersome as I thought it would be. Still getting used to the watch, I am enjoying the watch. Got this during prime days, and the savings were great. Very happy - does everything it is advertised to do.\\nBought the cellular version. Well worth the few extra bucks. AT&T charges $10 a month, plus tax to add it to your IPhone account. Enjoying my watch Good watch I really like it but don\\x92t feel like it\\x92s really waterproof for some reason.Other than that it\\x92s great I recommend it!! My wife and I purchased 2 Apple Watches and wear them everyday. Probably most interesting to us is the sleep tracking capabilities. We compare nearly every morning and feel it\\x92s pretty accurate. We also track our fitness and our pulse. I\\x92m glad we didn\\x92t spend extra and get the GPS option. We almost always have our phone with us and the watches connect so easily that all the functions we use are readily available. Glad we have them. Deducting one star because, so far - I\\x92m just concerned because the apple packaging appeared to be opened prior to my receiving and opening it. I did not purchase a pre-used item; I purchased a brand new item. I will need to boot the watch and test to see if there is anything off. Will update this review soon. When I was in grade school, calculator watches were the envy of tech people like me. Never could I have imagine I\\x92d one day own a watch like this.\\n\\nI am amazed that so much functionality is packed into such a small device. I really appreciate the medical features. I am glad I put off buying an Apple Watch until the series 7. The screen is amazing. The watch also charges very quickly.\\n\\nI ended up buying the starlight version. I was disappointed that Amazon was out of the black watch, but one of the neat features of the Apple Watch is the ability to replace the bands. By the way the sports bands are so comfortable!\\n\\nOne thing that\\x92s important to know before you buy an Apple Watch is the charger requires a USB-C port. It\\x92s a good thing I bought a battery bank that has a USB-C port a few weeks before, or I\\x92d have no way to charge my watch. Love being able to take calls while away from my phone. The watch looks good i like that i can change the face to multiple faces what i don\\'t like is that the battery must be charged every day. Love my Apple Watch except battery doesn\\x92t seem to last long before needs recharging Watch is very comfortable and works well, battery could do to be longer, I get about a day and a half with always on display turned off It was exactly what I expected and came super fast! I love my watch. It is awesome. So glad I bought it. Clearer screen & like the phone in it for emergencies Battery life is great no problem s I use this item for work and love all the features! What can you say, Apple does it right! There\\x92s only two things I don\\x92t like about the watch so far, so I\\x92ll start with that. The first is while listening to Spotify on my phone/headphones/helmet if the dial spins on the watch, it changes the volume. It\\x92s the worst while riding my motorcycle, because holding the handlebars causes the dial to spin, even when the watch display is off. So I\\x92ll be riding and then blow my eardrums out because it scrolls to max volume. I haven\\x92t figured out a way to turn it off, if there is one. The other thing I don\\x92t like is that there\\x92s no built in step counter. It relays on your cellphone for that, when every other watch style device has one and costs way less.\\n\\nThere\\x92s plenty of things I love about it so far though. It\\x92s great for phone calls and texting without your phone. Or seeing whos calling while your on a bike/motorcycle. And the durability is great. I play a ton of sand volleyball and it\\x92s great at keeping the sand out of it. Since I swim with it as well, I wasn\\x92t surprised, but I was really happy with that. Works great, fantastic display. Very functional. Should have bought the cellular model and gone for the full Monty Battery life much better and healthy features like ecg are amazing I\\x92m still learning on how to use it, I wore the series 3 for about 4 years and the settings on this baby keep me interested I\\x92m basically pleased with my new watch, except for 2 issues. The battery charge is too short. After syncing my phone and watch, i no longer get notifications of texts and sometimes phone calls. My husband and I both have tried to correct this to no avail. Good features. Phone connection good. Charges quickly I got this watch on sale for prime day and although it took it some time to get to me, it\\x92s an amazing watch! To top it off, the starlight color is to die for! Llegó súper rápido, nuevo totalmente con su caja sellada! So far like everything it does. I like everything about this watch! I love this watch with all its capabilities. It was also the best price I have found after shopping around! Love that it saves passwords now. Battery life still isn\\x92t great if you\\x92re a reader. The kindle app puts a drain on it. Overall I like it I like everything on this watch The need to recharge the watch in 24 hours I love my new watch! It\\x92s exactly what I ordered! Purchased as a 25th birthday present. She loved it! Love it easy to use Great product!!!! Love my new watch Unfortunately, I returned my watch. The band was extremely uncomfortable and hurt my wrist. There was also missing sleep data three different nights. I could not imagine wanting to wear it enough to get my moneys worth. Honestly I thought I was getting a deal for it - but I picked the wrong color and I paid full price. Regardless I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing with it and it feels like an expensive mistake. So I had a Fitbit and have used one for the past 7 years. I loved everything about Fitbit, from the simplistic ease of use to the excellent stats it kept to the battery life (about a week usually).\\n\\nI had the Ionic, which was recently recalled. I never had an issue with it, but I\\x92d had it for almost 3 years and thought, if they\\x92re going to refund me what I paid 3 years ago, I might as well try an Apple Watch. All in all I spent less than $100 for the 45mm Series 7.\\n\\nFirst impressions: I hated it. It\\x92s got waaaaay more functionality than a Fitbit, and that\\x92s not necessarily a good thing. It\\x92s too much if you\\x92re looking for a step counter, sleep/heart rate/activity monitor. Fitbit uses ONE app to easily display all the pertinent info you need. Apple Watch uses no fewer than THREE different apps - Fitness, Watch and Health - to monitor info and/or change watch displays. You can also download more apps to monitor things such as sleep. It\\x92s not complicated, but it\\x92s overly complicated and cumbersome. Apple should seriously consider hiring some people away from Fitbit and take some advice. Oh, and the battery life is absolute trash compared to Fitbit. I have to charge it every 24-36 hours, depending on usage. The good thing is that it does charge super fast, but I guess it probably should, considering the capacity is so awful.\\n\\nIt\\x92s basically an iPhone shrunk down to wear on your wrist. It has some interesting functionality such as making/receiving calls, and you can send texts from it, although the screen and keyboard are so small, it\\x92s best to use the pre-canned responses rather than try to type out an actual message.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but I\\x92ll try to sum it up. If you\\x92re a long-time Fitbit user, keep using Fitbit unless you just want to try something new. But beware. Even after two weeks of the Apple Watch I was considering sending it back, but I\\x92m sticking it out. When it dies, I\\x92ll probably go back to Fitbit unless they\\x92re out of business or Apple makes some much needed changes to streamline it and improve the battery life.\\n\\nHighly overrated. the only issue is battery life ..I have to charge it every night before bed time....but its worth it\\x85. I\\x92ve been doing research on my health condition about congestive heart failure\\x85 I suffered a cardiac arrest last year and comatose for 5 days and recovering, but I needed a device that will monitor my daily routine so I watched video of people who experienced sudden heart attack. This watch is perfect for me\\x85.. Big upgrade. Nice smart watch. I like watch. Short battery life when apps are used. Like band replacement. Need more waterproof features Great for health and exercise. Counts steps, tracks heart rate and blood oxygen. So convenient. If I\\x92m in one room and my phone\\x92s in another room, I can answer a call on the watch rather than running to the other room to get my phone. User manual is really long but you will find many useful tips in it. Needs to be charged every other day. Battery life not great Better than I expected I\\x92m learning more functions every day but I\\x92m unhappy with the battery life. I feel like I\\x92m always charging it. (48hrs is all I get between charges) value for money purchase Very pleased with it. Easy to put together easy to pair my iPhone easy to put the straps on \\x85.I started wearing it the moment I put it together\\x85. very happy with the product\\x85. I\\x92m delighted that it\\x92s waterproof and large screen is amazing!!! I love the retina feature it\\x92s really cool My wife loves it, no more to be said Great product. Good value. My wife has an Apple phone, she wanted to get the newest watch on the market by Apple... She loves it, got it for her birthday gift. Bought this for my wife. I\\'ve had a 6 watch for awhile now and no issues. Expect same great performance, but not giving five stars because Apple cut corners on this one and did not provide the USB-C adapter to allow charging out of the box. So, had to spend another $20 to get adapter to use charging cord that comes with the watch. This is an example of the stupid stuff companies like Apple do to their customers. Instead of providing the $20 adapter with the watch (yes, just add it to the cost), they play stupid games like this. I just hope they did not cut corners on the tech in this watch! Bought this as a gift for my bf. The battery life is great and delivered by promised day! Got a great deal for prime day as well! This watch is way better than previous generations. Great battery life, sleep tracking, and is an absolute catalyzer to working out and getting healthier. What is there to really say it\\x92s an apple seven watch it is what it is lol that\\x92s not generic it\\x92s not fake ass it\\x92s really Apple I have had zero problems with my watch and it works exactly how it should. I got in on a Prime Day Deal and I love it! Got this during prime day for almost 30% off and works like charm. You can never complain about apple products and this is one of the better ones. Loving it:) Best smart watch easy to set up and load everything from my iphone to watch. What\\'s not to like, it\\'s Apple? We caught them on sale $329.00. Su precio Excelente producto Shipping fast, good deal. Love it Great item! I found the series 7 watch to be a nice upgrade from the series 3. The heart rate app works much better. I like the large screen that can continually display. I found that the Battery life is improved as well. I originally purchased the 45mm, since during a sale it was only $6 more expensive than the 41mm. When I put it on, it was laughably way too big on my wrist. Imo it\\x92s really meant for a bulky man. I returned for the 41mm and so glad I did! Looks much more appropriate on my wrist! Also, this is an upgrade for me from the series 3 and I\\x92m blown away by the improvements made. If you\\x92re on the fence about upgrading, just do it. Nice watch.\\nYes, I know that Apple doesn\\x92t supply power blocks anymore.\\nBut, I didn\\x92t know you need a USB-C block.\\nNow I got a dead watch until a get a chance to go buy one.\\n\\nI guess I\\x92ll be wearing the Fitbit today.\\nThanks I love my new Apple Watch! Currently using it to track my sleep and activity levels! If you want to keep up with your health better, this is the way to go! Also makes replying to messages and getting notifications less annoying! No le dura nada la batería, por el precio esperaba algo más pero la verdad no tiene mucha diferencia de los otros relojes inteligentes en el mercado que puedes conseguir hasta en la mitad de lo que cuesta este Muy buena aplicación I love my series 7 Apple Watch . Trying to get to know it better. Any and everything needed right at my fingertips . It knows more about me than I do about myself. . Learning about it more , love it . My husband was the recipient of this Apple Watch which he loves! One of the main reasons for getting this watch is the fall factor. My children wanted me to get a monitor for that purpose!!! Now I have one! Feel so safe I have spent many $$ over the years purchasing \\x93no-name\\x94 brands of fitness watches. None last more than a couple months.I FINALLY got an Apple Watch! So far so good, but The blood pressure feature won\\x92t be available until 2023\\x85.I\\x92ll be patient\\x85. Water Aerobic So excited to upgrade from series 2 to this series 7. It paired perfectly and I have had no issues with apps or performance. BUT within 3 days, I noticed a big scratch down the screen. I\\x92ve worn that series 2 for years and no scratches. I have not been any places or situations that I would expect to cause a scratch. I\\x92m ordering a screen protector now. But am highly disappointed that my long awaited upgrade has a flawed screen in 3 days!! good I have used my watch for several weeks now. It\\'s easy to wear and simple to use. I have tried to use it to track my sleep, but it\\'s not very accurate and I really don\\'t like wear a watch to sleep. The battery can only hold for 1 day. It need to be charged everyday. Sometimes I forgot to charge it and it will definitely power off the next day. I can easily check messages and get notice by it, which is good! Overall I think it\\'s a good product for you, if you plan to exercise and record. second apple watch. couldn\\x92t be happier Use for exercise La batería me dura hasta día y medio y carga bastante rápido, me gusta que puedo estar checando las pulsaciones y la actividad de sueño, puedo usarlo para controlar mi Roku y eso me gusta bastante. Awesome item i sure he will like Birthday gift. Everything that you can do with this phone is crazy. I have been wanting one for long time. Just upgraded from generation 1 so happy I did the face is improved and I love being able to access the health apps a plus apple makes great products, what when you can a chance to save a few bucks like during prime days then it makes \"toys\" like this easy to obtain. the watch is easy to setup and works seamless with your other apple products. I like it. This apple watch does not disappoint at all. I love the many features its has + the look and the feel are amazing. It is awesome to have almost all my phone apps in my wrist at all times. I would think that a $300-400 watch would come w a way to use the watch for more than 1 day!! NO POWER SUPPLY FOR THE POWER CORD TO PLUG INTO...very odd. I guess my first Apple Watch has a learning curve :) Doesn\\x92t stay charged more than 48 hrs at a time. Original nuevo y excelente funcionamiento It\\'s size is a bit small but ok I love this watch so much. I purchased the Blue Aluminum Apple Watch (41mm , GPS only). I purchased it from Amazon as \\x93Open box-like new\\x94 and the watch came in perfect condition\\x85 nice savings of about $60! I also love how it matches/complements my iPhone 12 Pro Max color. I\\x92ve been obsessed with these colors ever since Apple released them! So far the watch is working fine if anything changes I will update this review but this is a nice watch I got on prime day for a decent price. Nothing Great, but the OS doesn\\'t support Whatsapp notifications not notification response interactions like the previous model. Slightly bigger screen. Improved battery life but not by much. Easy wrist band changes.\\nApple eco system and quality builds are elite in its own class. Battery is a factor here. Requires end of the day battery charging. Overall great quality, easy to connect to only IPHONES. Love it best watch ever glad got it so happy I did wear all the time I love this watch! It looks and feels great and the new features including the keyboard are all a lifesaver. Highly reccommend communication with I-phone I would like to see more choice of time , temperature and date face . Didn\\x92t really like the choices I upgraded from the Series 3 to the Series 7. The series 7 is so much better. The battery life is wonderful and it doesn\\'t take long at all to charge. He loves his gift, it\\x92s what he wanted and enjoys it too! Soo much mire than I expected and delivey an set up were seamless! Really a great watch a must have The battery life, screen size, and additional apps (available) are huge improvements from my previous iWatch. This is my first Apple Watch and I\\x92m really glad I went with this model. It looks even nicer in person and has a lot of neat features. The only thing I\\x92m not 100% happy with is the sleep tracking. It is not as sensitive as my other watch (not Apple) and can be off by up to an hour. I\\x92ve also noticed that if I wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep it may or may not go back to recording it. It\\x92s not really that big of an issue to me because it still gives me a general idea and reminds me to go to sleep. For the people complaining about not receiving a block\\x85 1) it explicitly states what comes in the box and 2) USB C to USB A adapters cost like $5 for a pack of 4. It\\x92s much more cost effective than buying a new block and if you place it in the same order as your watch you won\\x92t have to worry about waiting to charge it. Super fast shipping and everything. I upgraded from the Series 4 and it was so worth it. Everything I loved about the series 4 this series 7 does it even better. Plus I got more features. Would recommend. Moblie apps very helpful I have been looking at these since they came out. I was worried it would turn into one of those tech items that I had to have, only to sit there unused. I\\'ve had it a week and I really see myself using it all the time. The only real drawback I see is the battery life. When set to always on, it has to be charged daily. I would really like to see better battery life. I needed help setting it up correctly not technology savvy but I do love the fact that I don\\x92t need to carry my phone anymore Updated from the series 4 and love this in the red so much!! great product, instead of grabbing my phone out of my pocket i can just check it on my watch Got it the day before I went to the water park. Fantastic! Wore it all day at the park and then the river. I love it! Perfect. The only complaint is it had to be charged every night. Love the mobile aspect. As a senior citizen it will alert if I fell. A couple times I sat very hard and it asked if I fell. I feel more comfortable living my life knowing that if I fall, my watch will call someone. Battery life is atrocious. Won\\x92t last 24 hours. Also the step counter and Appa to support exercise tracking are lousy. If you want a good tracker and good battery life go with Garmin or one of the others. If you want a mini phone on your wrist for text messaging and notifications this is what you want. The watch itself delivered as promised with all the bells & whistles. However the watchbands isn\\x92t good. It doesn\\x92t stay clasped and nothing to hold the excess band in place buen producto Tracks all the things I care about custom for me. Great value Awesome product For those wondering, Amazon is a verified reseller. Genuine apple watch, amazing. It is a bit heavy on my wrist but does exactly what it\\x92s suppose to do Super happy with my purchase, it works great! The battery life is awesome! Battery does not last but a couple days. other than that love the watch. Love it! I love mine! I love how it watches my oxygen levels! Buenísimo! Lo único malo es que tardo 15 días en llegar pero se ve súper bien! Ahora a aprender a usarlo jeje upgraded from the 5 to the 7 and im in love.. i have no bad reviews or thoughts on this apple watch. I love my new Apple Watch series 7! It is a nice upgrade from the Apple Watch series 3. I enjoy the larger screen, the \\x93always on\\x94 watch face, and the chirps on the hour. La verdad me emociones cuando lo vi muy bien, estaba muy bien sellado todo no y viene todo completamente no falto nada . 5 estrellas , what I like the most about this watch series 7 is this feature Always-On Retina display also you can display photos, also easy to change faces and wrist bands.\\nbeats every other watch. I changed from Galaxy 3 Perfect size and works great! Highly recommend this apple product I lost my original Series 7 so I bought another one and can\\'t live without it. This one seems to have an updated OS. none My wife is in love with this the size is Super All the apps were working fine, but after two weeks the Watch stop working properly no color on any apps or photos. Fue un regalo de cumpleaños para mi esposo, le encantó la sorpresa! I love what this smart watch has to offer. I\\x92m able to track steps, heart rate, and blood oxygen as well as sleeping pattern. Plus, I stop missing calls and messages from my wife! I bought the Apple watch for its ability to track blood-oxygen percentages and for the electrocardiogram feature. What I use it for now is the original features that I wanted, but much more like: phone call notifications, wrist telephone, text notifications and many of the apps that are in my iphone, although the small size of the screen makes using some of them challenging. I am still finding more uses. Bought it for my mother. She loves it very much. It is easy to setup especially for the people who did not very familiar with the smart application. Case was sealed and everything seems to be good until I try to attach the band. It was broken. Texts and email notifications Tracking my miles & my heart rate. The Apple Watch is exactly what I wanted and more! Such great quality This is my first Apple Watch and I love it. It really helps me monitor my vitals.\\nThe only downside for me was that I\\x92ve had a really hard time connecting my watch to my cellular network. I didn\\x92t realize that I needed to create another line on my cellular plan which costs another $10 a month. That is my main problem right now. Still trying to get it connected to the cellular carrier I have. Great - Love my iwatch. Battery lasts a couple of days if you are a light user. Doesn\\'t come with a charger which is just dumb but whatever. Great price on these during Prime Day. It is exactly what I wanted to replace my first series iWatch. Love it. Fast delivery and great packaging. I previously owned a Apple Watch 3 and glad I upgraded to the iwatch 7.. nice size \\x85 sldusolay great. Play Video\\n\\xa0I was send the wrong color of watch and strap. It was supposed to be navy blue watch and strap but was givin stainless steal. The watch works perfectly fine and the strap does too just wish it was blue. Got it yesterday I\\x92m blown away ???? I upgraded from a series 3 wow what a difference I\\x92m blown away so much better so much faster thank god for prime day got it at a 120.00 discount ?????????? Lots of different functions. Very useful for tracking different activities and it looks awesome My new series 7 Apple watch appeared to arrive DOA. There was no way to start it or charge it because the magnetic charger terminated in a male USBC. I am in the computer business, and I had a female USBC to male USB adapter that I previously purchased from Amazon (cost $7 for 2-adapters.) I was then able to use the Apple charger to charge my new watch and set it up. The adapter can then be used to charge the watch.\\nPlease recommend that a female USBC to male USB adapter is purchased with new Apple watches. The product is good but I wished it was placed in front of my door, which it would have been hidden to passer Byers. Not at the beginning of the porch. A good watch for everyday excising Watch came brand new in sealed apple box. Don\\x92t be afraid to order. Watch came brand new with original box and paper work. My wife loved it Got it in prime day! It\\x92s perfect. Started with series 1, 4, 6 now 7. Yay! Absolutely love this watch for everything it does beside telling time This is my third I Watch. Love them. works great! Love the watch, and the delivery was fast I only use some of the features, but the ones I\\x92ve grown used to are fantastic! Being able to make quick replies to texts is wonderful, and the voice to text works well when I need to go into detail.\\n\\nSome things like the \\x93how long you have been standing\\x94 are horribly inaccurate. Other things like your heart rate are pretty spot on. My buddy has one and it told him his heart was having issues, he went into the ER and found the watch was right (bad news for him, but at least it was discovered).\\n\\nChecking weather or other functions are convenient, but it\\x92s really a matter of how much you want to load onto your watch.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is that the bands are on the small side. Mine is in the second to last spot, and in hot weather it will be on the last hole. Apple might want to remember that more than women and children have interest in these.\\n\\nLastly, this is not a watch I would trust for everyday general wear unless the hardest thing you do is sit at a desk. Sports, outdoor chores and similar activities would probably kill this thing pretty quick. Order received as promised no complaints about it, however the box was opened not sure why, hopefully this watch isn\\x92t used, set it up into my iPhone and so far so good,\\nKeep monitoring Wear it every day, it looks good and can monitor the necessary indicators. It would be nice if the battery was stronger. But the flaws do not hide the good, five-star product. Upgraded to a new Apple Watch and like the new features on the 7 compared to my 3. Great price from prime day. Color is not recommended DEAD PIXEL. I barely wore it; left it home on active days. Bought NEW from Amazon. Apple will not replace the dead pixel. I\\'ve worn 3 used watches since Series 2 and never had a dead pixel. I will NEVER buy a NEW Apple Watch again, obviously. They can\\'t be trusted against manufacturer defects. Always buy your Apple Watches from eBay so you know they won\\'t have dead pixels appearing just after the 90-day mark, conveniently.\\n\\nUPDATE: I had to send it to Apple three times before they finally authorized a FORCED REPLACEMENT to correct the manufacturer defect. Buy Apple Care or buy a used watch that\\'s been vetted against MFG defects! Does everything. Love the fact I can take phone calls with it. Great for exercise whether walking running or swimming. Tracks heart rate, EKG, simply amazing. Overall my husband is very pleased. However, Unlike my Apple Watch, the charger does not have a USB on the end. How is my husband supposed to charge his watch? Simply love it Received on time as described. I was able to immediately pair the watch with my iPhone without any issues. My daughter loves and she loves the water features on it along with the health app AMAZON I LOVE YOU THIS IS WHY I KEEP AMAZON PRIME AND BUY EVERYTHING HERE!\\nOK so guys, I bought this watch via the warehouse used in \"good condition\". Ummm... I honestly think someone bought this watch, took of the shrink wrap, opened it up, said \"nah, I don\\'t like this color\", and then returned it to amazon.\\n\\nI mean, just about everything was still untouched. Outside of the amazon renewed sticker on the front of the box and the scotch tape they used to close it up, most of this interior was like a new unboxing experience. The watch screen remained in its paper sleeve, and the screen was immaculate. The bands were not taken out, and the charging puck was still in its packaging.\\n\\nHere\\'s I think the best part: its still eligible for apple care +! Because Apple gives you 60 days to add from the FIRST person to purchase the watch, it was returned to amazon and sold so quickly to me, I still have that chance as the second owner.\\n\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned, I just bought a new apple watch 7 and saved a significant chunk of money. Thank you Amazon! My first smart watch. Bought on prime day. Absolutely love it !! Thank you AMAZON.. Love my new watch, and the speed of the deliver was INCREDIBLE in less than 10 hrs of my order, I had it in my wrist !!! GO TO LOVE AMAZON Love it!!! I don\\x92t think this Apple Watch is as good as my previous Apple Watch. It doesn\\x92t seem to be able to keep track of whether or not I am standing or sitting and doesn\\x92t track my steps! I have reset the app reset the Watch disconnected and reinstalled but doesn\\x92t change anything mentioned it keeps track of sleep and standing but keeps telling me to stand up even though I am still standing! Very nice. This is my favorite color! Fast shipping. I\\'ve used an Apple watch for over five years now and my older one was showing its age in terms of compute power. This new one is awesome - does everything the prior one does and more.. faster. The only thing they don\\x92t tell you is it doesn\\x92t come with an adapter, it should, because it\\x92s not USB The watch is reliable. It will not break or crack, and is the latest model; will always have your back. Small piece of band was broken in box, when installing the band it kept sliding right through. CRAZY great price for an awesome watch. Even my employee discount I had couldn\\x92t touch the Amazon deal. I love the watch. I love I don\\'t have to carry my phone around the house with me.\\nThe Health / Fitness tracker is great to keep me motivated to get up and move around. Purchased the device for the purposes 1) to track sleep and 2) to avoid missing notifications when the phone is away.\\n\\nGood:\\n- looks nice\\n- charges fast (you go to shower, get back - fully charged, but you need to use only the original charger)\\n- notifications are delivered effectively, with images\\n- Apple Pay works\\n- like other Apple products, has \"find me\" feature\\n\\nBad:\\n- heavy, especially if you plan to sleep with it on\\n- have to recharge every 24 hours;\\n- sleep tracking is weak because you must pre-configure sleep time range (i.e. 9pm-6am) in the app; otherwise feature does not work; if you take a nap during the day, it will not be counted; if you have an unstable sleeping schedule and need to rely on the device with tracking your sleep - better use Fitbit\\n- backward communication from the watch to iPhone, say, when you confirm a request in Authenticator app, works unstably\\n\\nSummary:\\nA very stylish gadget with convenient one-way access to notifications and simple built-in functions. If lose it - and you may due to frequent recharge - you can always find it. If you have requirements similar to mine, consider a cheaper device. If you desire Apple Watch for the sake of having another Apple product, price is justified. Easy 5 minute set up Great price as I have been looking for a deal. It is everything that was promised. Amazing Very nice This watch does it all - in a sleek, beautifully designed package. WAY better than my first gen Apple Watch; fast info right on your wrist. The best out there - period. I call or my \\x93wrist Mac\\x94 because it has everything I need! Overall its a good watch. I was not happy that i wanted the 45mm but some how got the 41mm, i think thats my fault when i placed the order, i did not notice it. Battery life is okay, about a day or two of battery life before you have to charge it. I have cameras and i can access my app turn lights on, however, i cant view the cameras. I would like for that to be fixed. Also when i receive pictures on whatsApp they appear blurry. Just switched to iPhone from android for the first time and I had to try out the watch to go with it. Love this thing can\\'t go a day without it. I liked mine so much that I made my mother and my wife both jealous so I bought both of them one too. I really like challenging them on the fitness app. Helps me push myself to exercise more. I upgraded my Apple because the microphone stopped working and cellular is not much use unless you can speak. Keeping the old watch to monitor sleep activity. Very pleased! So far I have enjoyed my Apple Watch would recommend I love my new Apple 7 watch. The features are great and easy to use. I love that I can have photos as my watch face. Best purchase in a long time. Produto excelente. Many additional advantages Love my new watch, quick shipment and easy to set up and operate. It has many health features. Phone quality is surprisingly good. Liked the easy use of apps on the phone. I especially liked the AFib monitor. Excelente I had an Apple Watch SE before and I love this new upgrade! The series 7 is a great watch and I\\x92m really enjoying it After years of using Pebble and Amazfit watches I decided to go Apple Watch because of the heart monitoring features and solid support for my iOS devices (phone, tablet). The watch works great. Getting it setup with my iPhone 12 Pro was just a non-event. It worked instantly.\\n\\nThe display is amazing. Just gorgeous. The reaction time with using the screen, crown, or button is instant. No lag at all.\\n\\nThe only issue I have is the battery. I never went to Apple Watch before Series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere I got is just untenable.\\n\\nSeries 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours. HA. I\\'m lucky to get 10 or 12 and it doesn\\'t even do much during the day. I\\'ve tested others like several Android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery.\\n\\nThe sleep tracking works fine, but it\\'s not comfortable to wear in bed all night. I don\\'t think any \"band\" is.\\n\\nOverall, I like it. I\\'ll use it. It works super well with my iPhone and the apps are great. But honestly, if I had known the battery life was this short with average usage, I would have probably gone with another Amazfit or the Pebble based FitBit Versa 3. I love this watch , It is everything I expected. There are so many options for different types of bands. It\\'s also great for keeping track of your overall health.\\nI don\\'t have to run to the other room to answer my phone I absolutely love that. This watch is a must have if you\\'re an Apple user Great apple packaging but it never came with a charging base, only the chord. So it couldn\\'t be charged and used when first received. Every feature of this watch is spot on! Purchased for emergency SOS, and for GPS location should I fall or otherwise need help. I love the gold stainless case and the ability to have a cellular connectivity as well as pair with my iPhone. I have had another apple watch (aluminum case) and liked it very much, but wanted a gold stainless case, thus the reason for buying this one. Re: SOS feature... I fell recently and the watch was faster at responding than my fall alert button for which I pay a monthly fee.\\nThe reason I gave the watch a 4 star review is because I thought I was purchasing a NEW watch, but in fact when it came and I placed it on the charger, it became very hot and I realized the battery must be bad. So, I investigated further and found out it was a refurbished watch (good condition). Am giving a 4 star review only because I am returning the watch due to battery heating up when on charge. I will purchase another apple watch... NEW this time. The wife loves it, she is the Apple fan in the family. I was very excited to get this. It is exactly as expected. Good battery life, comes with the charger, and easy to set up. Love my new watch! Purchased a few different bands so I could change up the look too! Wouldn\\x92t trade it for anything!! Great product. Easy to program and look very cool. Got it for Heart monitoring. Works great. It must pair with your iPhone, confusing which is dominate on various apps. Helpful to have an Apple store nearby or a teenager. Can not use regular wrist bands (apple unique). Can\\x92t get any better YO BUY DIS WATCH Me gustó mucho el Apple Watch, es el primero que tengo y no he tenido quejas, súpero mis expectativas de batería y rendimiento - great sturdy watch\\n- shipping was fast and the packaging was good\\n- battery life could be better Can\\x92t really add much to what has been said, but the Series 7 Watch hits all the right notes! I wasn\\x92t sure if I\\x92d even like a smart watch, but a friend that knows me well said I would and was more than correct!\\n\\nI am pleased with the simplicity yet sophistication of the platform and how it seamlessly handles information. It took me a couple of hours to get the basic functions down but I\\x92ve been pleased with the many personalizations available and wide-ranging features. Fun, versatile, useful. Recommend! Everything works really well. Able to track fitness goals along with operating everything from the watch instead of my iPhone all the time Easy to use and very versatile was surprised to have a compass option on the watch - awesome watch - does more than expected Loved it Like everything about it. Battery life is great and enjoy using the activity part of watch This product did not disappoint. It reminds me to stand every hour to increase my mobility I have been wearing my watch for a few weeks. Still getting use to it. I really like it. I am glad I bought it.\\nI use it every night for sleep. It is cool.\\nI did buy a different kind of stretch strap. It s easier to wash and dry hands with the stretch strap. not that bad , it is the best electric watch, but need to charge every night... Great watch This is a legit Apple product! Love this watch. I went from a series 3 to this series 7. I\\x92m mean WOW\\x85 what a difference! 100% recommend! Great look and healthy appo Upgraded from Series 3 \\x97 woah big upgrade!!\\nLove it, looks really good. Came in original Apple packaging with charger & band. A+++ Buy Heart rate and oxygen Had this watch for maybe three weeks now? So far it works great, I love the sleep tracking and the ecg apps. I\\x92m a telemetry tech so I find it neat to see my own rhythm and not have to put on the hospitals box to see it ??\\nThe battery lasts roughly 24 hours depending how much I\\x92m on it (which is a lot because I\\x92m still toying will all it has to offer). Love that I can locate my phone with my watch and vice versa (yes, I lose my phone a lot in my own home). I didn\\x92t realize I could actually take calls on the watch, that was pretty cool the first time I answered, and it was clear. Love that instead of looking down at my phone while using gps, it\\x92s right on my wrist where to turn. Overall my switch from android in general has been pretty successful so far. Just wished I didn\\x92t have to charge the watch every day while my phone lasts 2-3 (sometimes 4) days. I just charge it while I\\x92m folding laundry and it takes roughly an hour to reach 100%, so I will take that fast charge any day! A must have for all Apple enthusiasts! Estaba dañado I upgraded from a series 3. I love all the new features. Everything came how it was supposed to. Pairing was so easy. I was kinda scared because of some reviews, but it didn\\x92t take long at all. I love the Apple Watch !! No longer do I have to carry my phone around with me. My watch is all I need to texting, answering calls ! The watch itself is fine, not much different from the 6. The \"faster\" battery charging is very misleading. Yes if the watch is very low - it charges to 30% very fast. But after that it is a snail. I don\\'t charge it at night because I want to use the sleep tracking feature. I also got the 6 and now the 7 for the fall detector feature. With my six i could put it on the charger while I ate a meal or took a shower, and it was almost fully charged. The 7, it spends more time on the charger than my wrist, which kind of defeats the purpose of why I use the watch. And let\\'s not forget to mention that they6 changed the charger type -- so you will probably have to get a new upgraded charger before you can use the watch. If this \"save the battery\" feature is a programing thing ---please get rid of it or give the user the choice of which way they want to charge the battery. I am very disappointed in the watch. By far the best Apple Watch so far, the features are amazing for such a good price. Love the watch! Was good deal and I like it. Second Apple Watch for me. Excellent watch. Well worth every cent that you pay for it. So to start, pretty cool you can use it for texts calls and such, but it sucks knowing your carrier doesn\\x92t support apple watches after years they have been around.. you\\x92d think all services support them. another problem my watch had a few scuffs nothing major but was it used? Didn\\'t look used but nothing that would bother me so much. Overall looks sleek the band is slightly dark navy blue but black?.. pretty much midnight sky color, id recommend the watch to anyone just make sure you\\x92re service provider is eligible for it. It took a lot for me to switch from wearing my collectible Invicta watches but after purchasing and wearing while working, walking, working out and syncing with my iPhone for health logs\\x85..I was sold! I suggest if this is your desires or need to reconsider if you have doubts, i did and very happy with my decision! Just ok should of gone with the SE Watch is nice like others. Went with the 7 over the SE for the battery but don\\x92t notice any difference for the extra money Exelent Apple usually does quick, but the m/l band to big S/m comes off in my sleep Fue el regalo de cumpleaños Pat mi hija y ella amo su reloj After 7 iterations, I finally got my first Apple Watch. The reason why I held up so long was because of a simple question: WHY DO I NEED AN APPLE WATCH?\\n\\nFor the most part, I am pretty simplistic and live by minimal means. The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof, durable, and has great utility. The AP7 does it all. I\\'m also getting older, and I want to keep track of my health. I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health.\\n\\nThe AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture. I\\'m able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does, in some form, interrupt my productivity. The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.\\n\\nIt is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro, and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates.\\n\\nHowever, my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life. It doesn\\'t bother me so much, but I have to charge it every night.\\n\\nIt looks amazing, has professional and luxury vibes, and is pretty customizable. There are non-OEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking.\\n\\nOverall, I am pretty happy with it! Cheers. Excellent product no doubt Didn\\x92t like the fact that it didn\\x92t come with a plug end for the charger I\\x92ve used the ECG app and 02 sat app and both work great Absolutely in love with this watch it does it all! And looks stylish. It\\x92s a great product to use all features of the Watch starting with counting steps, tracking sleep and many more I like that it is bigger than my old Apple Watch. Todo muy bien The battery lasts longer for me than expected. I can go a day and a half without charging it. Sleep tracking is not detailed, but it is hard to beat the rest of the health features. Works wonderfully Play Video\\n\\xa0Good watch, definitely a good upgrade from my series 2. Go for it if you\\x92re considering it. Haven\\x92t measured the life span of the battery but it seems to be making good time from its charge.\\nThe green doesn\\x92t look very green (if that makes sense) it almost looks black -in a certain light, so don\\x92t be put off by it. This is about my 7th smart \"watch\". I\\'ve have a couple of Fitbits, a Jawbone, a Zenwatch 3 (prettiest of the bunch), a Samsung Galaxy, and an Amazfit Bip (good watch for the money). I\\'ve basically got a smart watch museum. I got the Apple Watch because, honestly, I\\'m getting older and I wanted the fall detection and health features. I\\'ve had it for a couple of weeks and here\\'s what I think, from bad to good.\\n1. Battery life sucks. It\\'ll get through one day, but that\\'s it. The Bip would last for 3 weeks on a charge.\\n2. The screen isn\\'t great in direct sun. It\\'s better than some others, but doesn\\'t hold a candle to the Bip, which was somehow reflective in bright light, sort of like a Kindle.\\n3. The sleep tracking is ok, about what you\\'d expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn\\'t very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.\\n4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.\\n5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn\\'t get in the way at all.\\n6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.\\n7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.\\n\\nIt has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun. Lots of other things. The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it\\'s unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were. Pro\\x92s. Got the 45 , nice large face. I\\x92m 6\\x924 and 215. / easy set up just scan the face and follow prompts ( I have the iPhone 11) / heart app including ecg works great ( why I bought it) /decent price. Cons no wall wart for charger cable / strap is garbage, I replaced with a snap flex metal look type /I also bought a set of three screen protectors. / made in China unfortunately/. As it stands now, after a week, (unless they make a health watch with equal gizmos in the USA ) I\\x92d buy it again. If something changes and the watch boinks out , I\\x92ll change my review. Oh and watch the price, it seems to fluctuate every few days. Now it\\x92s 371. I paid 379 and yesterday it was 419. And I did put the watch in a kinda sleep mode ( come on with wrist movement or tap the screen) and it surely helps battery life a lot. Still needs charging at some point every day. I especially need it at night. I bought this to replace my Series 1 watch that finally gave up the ghost (still worked but screen burned out). As this is Series 7 I was expecting a lot. Aside from an EKG and not very accurate blood oxygen monitoring, this watch is not a vast improvement. Battery life is just as bad. And yeah it has a sleep monitor - but who can use it because battery is almost dead when I go to bed. So it\\x92s kind of useless.\\nI bought it to help keep track of workouts/walking. And it does that just fine.\\nSo - while I am a fan of this watch and wear it every day. I think that Apple needs to spend more time improving performance and features. Obsessed with my Apple Watch!!! Perfect I love my watch. I like being able to not have my bulky phone with me. I live at the beach so it is convenient when walking the beach or at the pool. I haven\\x92t learned to use all the features yet but so far I love it! I love my watch, it is easy to use. Super value here!! I\\'ve had an iwatch-3 and decided to upgrade to a 7. This new watch is one of the most amazing electronic products I\\'ve ever owned. It took me 5 minutes to set up (it used all my old watch\\'s settings automatically. I am very glad I purchased this, even though on paper I was not sure the upgrade would be worth it. The screen is great, the phone works great and all of the health and exercise apps are phenomenal. The battery goes down only 50% after the entire day. I use my old magnetic charger (and NOT the new \"high speed\" usb-c charger that comes with the 7 ) and it still charges just fine at night. very good thanks Very nice and love it I like everything about this series 7 watch! My Apple Watch is working again so I\\x92m grateful for that. However it definitely is not easy to maneuver and work with compared to the Fitbit. I have to tell it that I\\x92m exercising and what exercise I\\x92m doing, instead of just identifying like the Fitbit, that I\\x92m exercising. It\\x92s difficult to follow the sleep coverage/data. However I am OK with it. Not thrilled, I don\\x92t like it as much as I like my Fitbit, but now that it\\x92s working again I\\x92m OK with it. Hence I\\x92m raising it from one star to three stars.\\n\\nIt was challenging adapting to the Apple Watch after using the Fitbit for so long. I definitely preferred the Fitbit in many ways. But what pushed me over the line, is two days after my return warranty, the Apple Watch stopped working. Two days. Very frustrating and quite frankly disgusting and not OK. I love this watch so light compared to my series 3 Apple watch. I love the bigger face Highly recommended for those who already own apple equipment Perfect replacement for my lost Apple Watch 6. Perfect fit and color for myself. Como reloj es genial, liviano, resistente al agua, con muchas funcionalidades y atención de SIRI constante, la batería podría ser de mayor duración, ya que esta dura un día y medio, pero en lo demás es una herramienta que vale la pena. Incredible features. Will take a while to learn all of the capabilities. Great buy during Prime Days. Perfect size for petite frame. Love price! Fast shipping. Great investment for healthy lifestyle!!\\nNeeds charging daily, but does so quickly.\\nAppreciate having all my Apple devices synced. I was so disappointed that it did not come with a charging chord. I had many apple chargers but none worked. I had to go buy a new charger. For the price of the watch you think it would have come with a charger. I love the functionality of my Apple Watch. I have to charge the battery every night so the sleep tracking function is out. I also had an allergic reaction to the metal post that holds the watch band closed. It\\x92s supposed to be stainless steel but must contain some nickel. I had to buy a different band. Awesome product! Heart and EKG Upgrading from a series 3 to 7 love the new look and screen size. New functionally is fun as well. Big fan of apple watch my day to day would be much more difficult without it. Fantastic!!! Great watch. Very good. Good buy Would not change it for the world wonderful watch Received with small scratch Love it Unfortunately, I did not realize Starlight was beige. Back it goes. Very nice Watch nice upgrade from 41 mm watch I love the health apps - Oxygen, heart rate, EKG, and the activity monitor and workout tracking are very motivating. It\\x92s nice and convenient to have a phone, timer, music and podcasts on my wrist. All in all, am very happy I finally broke down and got it (on sale). I got the regular sport band - if you\\x92re interested in the braided solo loop, I highly recommend getting fitted at an Apple Store or Best Buy. Bought on prime days! Great watch Na Had been meaning to get an apple watch for quite some time and I\\x92m super happy that I did! I like that the watch came with two different band lengths so that you could figure out what works better for your wrist. Set up was pretty easy as well! Happy so far! I love my watch\\x85Sleep tracking, PulseOx and ECG are my favorites. Great watch I use/ wear mine every day! My watch lasts about a day and a half. Not familiar with the sleep tracking or the most app. I debated ordering this watch because I\\x92ve never paid so much for a watch. Worth every penny! I\\x92m happy that I treated myself. I love totally it! i LOVE this watch! great purchase!! so happy with it! Apple Watch arrived on time and work\\x92s great and was easy to set up and had no problems with it so far its elegant smart and fun I like it for tracking my sleep patterns I love the functionality of this watch. Battery life has been less satisfying; has to be charged daily, even with settings adjusted to conserve battery life. I can accommodate this so will keep using the watch. Love all the apps that it has!!\\nBatter does last a lot longer than my three that I still have!! This keeps me off my phone while helping me look cool! Would buy again This is my first Apple Watch and very pleased with the functionality of this Apple product. When ordering through Amazon with Apple Care Plus, check to make sure if the order details show a serial number that it matches the Apple Watch. Mine not however Amazon rectified the issue. Bastante bien todo funciona a la perfección Amazing watch! Perfect! This was my first smart watch and waited this long to make sure after many iterations of this watch, it would have many sensors and be durable. As for sensors it is great. As for durability I got tricked into believing this hype of Gorilla glass blah blah and how it is stronger than previous gen etc. My screen got scratched on the 2nd day of wearing it very deep. I wish I bought screen protector on day 1 like I do with phones. I thought on iteration 7 it should be somewhat scratch resistant, nah, do not believe the hype. Love this watch!!!! Apple never fails me! Like having a computer on my wrist Wife finally made the move from Fitbit to Apple Watch. The issue she has is the battery life. I love the apple features and experience Way more reliable and resistant to knocks than my Apple 5! Great battery life and charging speed! Works perfectly- only problem is that the box was damaged. It was thrown into a box 5 times it\\x92s size unprotected- it could have been damaged if it was mishandled Super great deal on Amazon Prime Day! Saved a lot! My wife is using the watch track her exercise activities. The Apple Watch 7 is so much faster and more responsive than my Watch 3 it\\x92s shocking. Like it\\x92s night and day. Kinda cool that my Apple Watch is useful again! Also the bigger screen is seriously way larger. It\\x92s really helpful when glancing over an email or text. Also visibly thinner than the Watch 3 EXCELENTE the carrier did not listen to the words, put the damn thing at our back door next to our gate and put it in-front of the house where everyone can see and take it, but this watch is pretty nice, i use it for walkie talkie, quick text, heart rate for my weed when i do alot. it is good for if i have a seizure and i cant move after it i can walkie talkie my mom to come and help me fast and easy, she has the series 5 i have this one. but it was irritating to set up. It took some time to understand how to use the watch versus the mobile app. YouTube\\x91s were helpful.\\nCouple of tweaks needed: the sleep tracker is not entirely accurate. There are times when I know I was awake and it shows that I was sleeping. Sometimes it\\x92s hard to request a work out verbally using Siri. If you don\\x92t have the exact wording, the work out is not recognized.\\nI love all of the Health tracking information. I purchased this for the EKG option. It\\'s been a few months and I\\'m not sure I will.\\n\\nCompared to my Garmin watch, which my husband has now. This is not a good purchase.\\nIt needs charged every day. It takes about 30 minutes to charge which is not bad.\\n\\nSleep tracking program is a joke. My Garmin would give me details of my sleep modes.\\n\\nWatch itself is more comfortable and quality is there. The programing leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nIf I hadn\\'t given my Garmin to my husband, the watch would have gone back. at first i spent days trying to make it work. couldnt get notifications the always on did not work. after returning one then a whole day on the phone with apple support. finally the last guy i talk to ask if i had tattoos on my wrist. so i tested it on my daughter and it worked. i moved my watch to my right arm (hard to get use to) but has worked ever since. something in the ink blocks the signals so most features of the watch will not work as they should. other then wrong arm now i love the watch. would recommend getting the screen protectors when buying the watch they give a good wrap around protection. My motivation to get an Apple watch came after a very poor support event from Fitbit. Nearly everyone I know who has an iPhone, has an Apple Watch. I was the hold-out largely because the battery needs charging daily. Well, I got over that problem by charging the watch while wearing it. I\\'m at a computer for many hours in the day, so I loosen the Milanese Loop Band and slip the charging disk under the watch and continue my activity.\\nIt\\'s got so many great features such as podcast; pause, start, volume, O2 level, timers, workout access, walky talky, and so much more. I\\'ve only had the watch for under a month and there is so much to learn about what it can do. I am looking forward to find what else this little gem can do. The Apple watch is an amazing device, and it integrates flawlessly with my iPhone. My main reason for getting it was to encourage exercise beyond my normal routine. To that end it has been a great extension. Not only does it encourage exercise, but it tracks every movement, and gently prods improvement. With the cellular feature, if I forget my phone at home, the watch still enables me to remain in contact, and reachable by my family. With my T-mobile account, it only adds $5 a month to have the extra security of cellular connection for the watch. I bought this at my dr\\x92s suggestion to use the ECG function. That works well. I could easily send the readouts to my Dr. What I didn\\x92t expect was for the watch to motivate me to move more. I was already active but now I move even more. I also like the fact it vibrates when my phone receives a text or call, even if the phone is in another room. It was so easy to sync with my iPhone. I like my watch a lot. Comfortable to wear (and I hate things on my wrist but no problem) The watch is very intuitive. I really like the health apps and how the watch supports those programs. Very user friendly and so far its been great. Perfect, another great product from Apple Play Video\\n\\xa0I\\x92m new to apple, I recently changed from using android for over 10 years to an iPhone because I really liked the Apple Watch. I can honestly say I love the Iwatch series 7. I can track not just my daily steps and calories burned but also monitor my heart rate, blood oxigen and heart rhythm. I\\x92m able to get all notifications that I want on my watch, receive and answer calls and texts. Plus I can personalize it to my needs abs style by changing the faces and bands. The color is very nice.... Apple is slowly improving these things. But they really need to work on battery life. good????? Like every single thing in this tracking device Light weight. Doesn\\x92t weigh my arm down. Love the bands so comfy. Worth the price. Much better than a Fitbit. Bought two. Both people who wear them broke out on their wrist after only wearing them for a couple months. One wears theirs all the time the other only wears it Monday to Friday at work (inside). Not sure why the rash but it itches and takes weeks to clear up and not wearing the watch. My last Apple Watch never did this to my skin. Poz here and want to support HIV research Really like this watch. Love the activity app. Got it for the health features but it has lots of thing that make it very handy. Awesome It\\x92s a very and advanced watch, I love it Excellent Just love it Great watch! Love most everything about it. No complaints except I wish I would have bought one earlier. Faster charging alone makes it worth the money Super fast charging time!! Me agrada lo fácil que es su manejo y me mantiene en chequeo de mi caminatas o mi corazón Fast shipping, great price. The watch is amazing So far so good Does not keep up with my sleep, battery life is ok, but not great. All the apps don\\x92t work like they did when I purchased it 4 months ago. I do like being able to answer phone on it, does a great job on\\nHeart rate. It causes my I phone not to notify me of all my messages This watch is amazing. It\\'s sleek, fancy, and it works very well. There is so much that can be done on this watch; it is amazing. Quite the upgrade from a Fitbit. Highly recommend. Ease of use I love the watch very much. Play Video\\n\\xa0Loved my Series 3 but it was starting to get pretty slow This fixes ALL of that! It\\x92s an Apple product, not much to say Love the watch. Great features and easy to set up and use. But seriously though, $300 for a watch and they don\\x92t include a charging block? That\\x92s pretty lame. Great watch. I bought two, one for me and my spouse. Haven\\x92t had an Apple Watch in about 2 years. Love how nice the new ones are. There\\'s no secret, as new smartwatches keep joining the battle, it\\'s still Apple who keeps winning the race. Workout tracking, steps, heart rate, ECG, blood oxigen, unlocking your iPhone and Mac without Face ID or passcode, Apple Pay, notifications for all apps on your wrist, etc. It\\'s a very cool gadget to have, very useful and very functional.\\n\\nTo me, the only down side is still the battery. There are other smartwatches that beat the Apple Watch big time on battery, so it makes you wonder what does Apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days.\\n\\nAside from the battery, which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour (The charging is super fast now), there\\'s nothing else to complain about. I picked the aluminum red one with the standard silicone band and I absolutely love it. Loving my new Apple Watch and beat all the prices out there! Apple Watch I bought this watch as a gift for my son even though he hates watches. I am very glad to say this watch does absolutely everything expected and he loves it where is it every day & night only takes it off to charge it.?? She loves it being 11 , it\\'s a big deal for her. Received one with a defect but it was quickly replaced. My wife loves everything about it. Except for battery life of course which is somewhere around 1.5 days so forces you to charge it every night if you don\\'t want them to turn off unexpectedly. Therefore 4 stars. Love the health apps. Everything exceeded my expectations Excellent!! Very fast !! as advertised. Works great, no regrets I love my watch! It alerts me when I have a new text message while I\\x92m at work. It\\x92s very comfortable to wear. Apple Watch Series 7 has reinvigorated mine, and my wife\\'s fitness activity. It\\'s downright infectious. We now try to \"out workout\" each other. Plus, both of our watches look great and the technology is amazing. I tripped over a seam in the sidewalk yesterday and my watch wanted to call an ambulance. I didn\\'t need it, but if I had the watch could have been a lifesaver. Couldn\\'t be more pleased with these watches. I use my watch for rental property alerts while working or multitasking. Love how much time it saves me from looking at my phone constantly ?? We waisted 2 hours in Verizon trying to set it up. They could not do it. They tried 4 different times. They told me it was an issue with the e-sim card. So we went next door to T-Mobil. Now I spent 2 hours with T-Mobil, and getting the same issue. I am sending this crap watch back. I wish they will give me my 4 hours back.\\n\\nI ended up spending an additional hour at Sprint and after few software updates, Sprint figured it how to make it work. The watch now works just fine. I purchased for gift and she said it\\'s nice. But the face is large then my last one and battery life is better. Oh and it\\'s waterproof.smile, you just can\\'t make this up.\\nShe enjoy the watch from phone call to do not disturbed,locate her cell,home alarm system and you know the list goes on.\\nI hope you find this info useful but what more can I say it is apple ?? I have to admit: this watch has been encouraging me to exercise more and it is fun keeping track of my workouts and walks. I like the ECG feature, though I have no reason to believe I have a heart problem.\\n\\nBut one bummer: I already have a scratch on the face of the watch. One of the Apple Watch Series 7 selling points was a more scratch resistant screen. It seems now like just a marketing ploy. And I wish the battery was as strong as other smart watches... I find myself recharging before I go to bed so I can track my sleep and use the watch when I wake up and work out.\\n\\nOverall I\\'m satisfied with the watch, especially since it was on sale! As a long-time Apple Watch user, I initially thought that the Series 7 was not worth upgrading to. After all, my trusty Series 4 had many of the same features (delivering notifications silently on my wrist, sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and an EKG party-trick ability that I rarely use but is cool to have I guess) and was more than adequate enough for my use case. However, my Series 4\\'s battery life was waning, and I was itching to move on from a rose gold watch, so when I saw that the price of this particular Series 7 variation dropped to $379, I knew I could afford to pull the trigger. Compared to my Series 4, this watch has many iterative improvements, including an always-on display, slightly larger screen, and a blood oxygen sensor, that when taken as a whole, make me a happy customer. The midnight color is definitely better-looking in person as well! If you\\'re an existing Apple Watch user and have an older model, then this is an upgrade worth considering. If you\\'re looking to get into the smartwatch world and have an iPhone, then this could be a good starter smartwatch for you. This is a incredible watch, from the easy use of the apps/keyboard/calculator numbers with my big clumsy finger to the phones mic and speaker while talking to someone. I love the many phone faces that are provided as well as the options you are able to use from your photo albums and the ability to download faces. I thought the 45mm was going to be like other large watches I use to wear that dug into the hand when pushing yourself up. But the Apple Watch is one of the smoothest watch I have owned. The Apple Watch will be my watch for everyday use for the foreseeable future at least until I win the lottery and can buy a Philippe Patek for my daily banging around watch! I got this watch for myself as my FIRST ever Apple watch\\x85 I absolutely looove it\\x85 I don\\x92t know how I went this long without one and I don\\x92t think I could go without it now\\x85 it\\x92s so easy and convenient to have your phone on your wrist, so to speak\\x85 honestly the only downside, in my opinion, is that for the price tag of the Watch, they should have come up with a better wristband material than silicone\\x85 I think it makes it look cheap and not very comfortable when you start working up a sweat\\x85 luckily there are many options for replacing the bands though\\x85 but overall happy with my purchase ???? I like it I don\\x92t love it. I don\\x92t use it to track my sleep because I have to charge it. Battery lasts less than two days so I am in the habit of leaving it on its docking station to charge at night. Also, first and foremost it should be a good watch. Half the time I look down to see what time it is and some app pops up. I love my Apple Watch, I thought the battery would last longer, but other than that everything is great I like the watch very much. At the current price it\\x92s a pretty good deal for Apple users.\\nHowever I would prefer a single app that consolidates all the data in a single, drill down type dashboard. As it is, it takes me a while to figure out which app\\x92s settings drives what data on the watch. Such as resetting the stand goal. Still looking for that\\x85.\\nAlso would love to know more detail on how many exercise minutes in cardio or fat burning or REM vs restful sleep.\\nStill, it connects quicker to my Ring app than iPhone, makes answering calls much simpler than trying to find the phone, and has the essential stats anyone needs to track fitness.\\n\\nJust think all the supporting apps are battery intensive and kinda confusing. Bought it for work mainly. It works great wear it every day battery definitely last all day. Play Video\\n\\xa0My battery fantast Connect in my phone very easy tell me everything I need Every Works great and all but just missing case as it\\x92s written it will come with a case and sports band Bought this for my wife to replace her Fitbit versa 3, which is a great watch except that the screen fell out of it\\'s base. She\\'s had prior Fitbit watches but thought the Apple watch would be a better upgrade, big mistake. Where as the Fitbit gets a week out of each charge, the Apple barely gets 1 full day. A lot of on-line complaints of battery life on this newest version, with no help from Apple. I was hesitant ordering an Apple Watch from Amazon since I always do it on the Apple.com website - but went with Amazon because of a sale price and great reviews. I upgraded from the series 5 to the series 7 and I love it! Very happy with my purchase. Me gusto Mini version of cell with mini apps. Best to help keep track of your health and calorie counting! Take advantage of the health apps! This watch face is too small - doesn\\'t show up well - one day late frome being postmarked the 23rd of August 23 20222- My husband was in er 2 xs and i could not take care of the return mailing - so I am sending back today and hope ubder the circumstances this will be ok Thanks Blossom Morris Great accessory if you own an apple phone Love my Apple Watch, very comfortable on my wrist More like a phone then a fitness watch , daily wear if you have a small child it will fall off your wrist continuously every time you pick up your child band doesn\\x92t hold . Good applewach He came exactly as advertised. The features are great. Mobile Apps & price is great Definitely like the watch. Great apps, heart, health and otherwise. Not as masculine as the Samsung, battery on Samsung lasts DAYS, this Apple lasts all day but needs charging daily. Easier to travel with the Samsung. Just note that the Samsung is only somewhat compatible with the iPhone. Used to be an android user but moved to iPhone several months ago. Battery is only good for a day Love it! Although I am not a fan of the band that was included. It is too thick. I have bought other more comfortable bands. I have not had any trouble learning how to use it. That is great for a senior lady like me! Lol Love personalizing watch faces!\\nBattery lasts about 2 days and there are numerous apps available. Got it today and set up. Definitely worth the money and wait to get it and it arrived a day earlier than estimated! Highly Recommend My daughter loves it It has so many functions, it will take me a little while to learn them all but super excited to have this watch! The color is Beautiful! The band that comes with it is not white but an off white beige. Not gonna lie I was Skeptical about buying this Watch but now I need it abuse I use it with my iPhone and it\\x92s really handy and because of it I\\x92ve lose weight through it like see how many calories I\\x92ve burned through walking and keeps my on where I walking during my workouts and for about about a month since I got this I\\x92m happy to say I\\x92ve lost 20 pounds it\\x92s help me keep track of my progress no bullship I highly recommend it if you never had an Apple watch and the keyboard feature it kinda neat I have had my watch for a week now and can\\'t really say anything bad about it. The battery life is excellent on it, it was very easy to pair with my phone (not sure why others were having such a time doing that). All the features work just as they would on your apple watch. The only thing I keep forgetting is the feature of the ear pods when I answer a call (everyone can hear your phone conversation if you answer with your watch with no pods in). I recommend you get another band if you have any allergies to silicone (that is the type of band that comes with the watch). The more things you add to the watch the more space and battery life that the watch will eat up. Enjoy it. GOOD I upgraded from the 6 se- I wanted the o2 and the ECG options that the se didn\\x92t offer .. watch arrived exactly as expected in apple box with the charger- watch works perfectly with no issues. Connected to my iPhone 12 without flaw. Battery life is the same as my se but the charger that came with the 7 is amazing it\\x92s a fast charger and I love it! My watch can be completely dead and I put it on charge and it\\x92s fill in no time at all. I have noticed it seems that the 7 has a few more exercises to choose from - overall I definitely would recommend It\\x92s a good looking watch and comes in handy for many things. It will make you\\x92re life a lot easier. But this watch has a bad battery life. 18 hours max life. Other brand watches with similar functions can last up to 36 hours.\\n\\nAlso, this watch is bit heavier to wear to sleep.\\nIt\\x92s not a seamless watch for a sleep wear. Love it Good watch...tells time. date, weather, etc Great features. Easy to set up. Love the exercise apps. Never miss a phone call or text message because you can answer them with your watch. So many options. Highly recommend. Play Video\\n\\xa0Excelente. Me encanta!?? It took six hours to set up\\n\\nI am a techy electronics engineer. I have dozens of patents in electronics and have written thousands of lines of computer code, in three different programming languages. But this watch is quite a challenge.\\n\\nWhen I tried to pair the watch to the phone, the phone said I must update the phone to OS 14.8.1. Yet I have always had \"automatic updates\" \"on\" in the phone menu.\\n\\nSo I spent a half-hour updating to OS 14.8.1.\\n\\nI tried to pair the watch to the phone again and the phone said my OS must be updated. But I had just updated it. So I called apple support. They directed me to update my OS to 15.1. Why was I previously directed to update to 14.8.1 when that was obsolete? Updating to 15.1 took an hour!\\n\\nNext when I tried to pair the watch, the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch. I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB \"C\" charger which is not included with the watch. Do you have such a charger? I didn\\'t even know such chargers existed. I have ten chargers, including several made by apple, and they all only accept the original USB plug, called USB \"A\".\\n\\nI recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers. I thought, that\\'s ok, we all have lots of chargers. But nobody has USB \"C\" chargers, they are very new.\\n\\nSo I ordered a USB \"C\" charger.\\n\\nThe charger arrived I started the pairing process. But the phone stuck for 30 minutes during the pairing process so I called support. They couldn\\'t get it to work by the standard way, which is to update the watch software, so they opted to install without updating the watch software. That worked with lots of hand holding and took about 45 minutes\\n\\nAll together I spent about six hours getting the phone to work.\\n\\nHas apple lost their mind? Absolutely love this! Still learning how to use it. Wasn\\x92t sure I wanted one. When I saw all the features it had, I replaced my Fitbit with a Series 7. Don\\x92t use for sleep tracking because I don\\x92t like wearing jewelry to bed. I check my Blood Oxygen, do an ECG and check my heart rate every morning. Love it! What made me buy this is a review from a purchaser that said it saved her life because of the heart monitor. So far so good I love it I even purchased the model that said GPS only but I can talk and make calls on it, adding cellular I think is a ploy for phone carriers to make more money. You can just get the GPS only and still make and receive calls on your watch using your phone number NOT a phone number the phone company gives you that is separate from your phone and then charge you for it. I bought it used but it still has warranty on it. I enjoy all the features and comprehensive abilities of my Apple Watch, but the short battery life means it\\x92s dead before the end of the day. Battery life could be better but it is a well made watch and works well! You must take the time to learn the applications. Learn how to use the watch and phone together. Remember \\x93Apple Help Line\\x94 they are very knowledgeable and will assist you. The people complaining about the C charger have me rolling! 1. It has nothing to do with how the watch functions, and 2. If you can afford this watch, you can surely afford a cheap charger.\\nNow about the watch: Amazing! Its everything its advertised to be. The Amazon price is by far less than anywhere I shopped. I ordered the watch Friday evening and received it Saturday morning. Definitely recommend. Doesn\\x92t come with new charger for smaller plug in cord Wanted for a long time\\x85 price is great!!\\nPerfect I have only had the Apple Watch for 13 hours, too soon to write a review? Perhaps which is why I\\x92ll come back and update it at a later time but I just wanted to post my initial thoughts. I saw so many reviews about the battery life and I hate to say it but they were all true. I fully charged the watch prior to setting it up and using it at 6pm on 6/29 I went to bed at 10pm fully charged at 100% here it is 6am on 6/30 and it\\x92s already down to 80%! At this rate I\\x92ll have to charge it again by the end of today. My fit bit lasted nearly a week before needing a charge. Apple do better!\\nThe watch itself is very nice, sleek design, fairly easy to use, lots of things you can do with it. I\\x92m just getting started so I\\x92ll update the review in a few days. But overall very disappointed in the battery life. Took awhile to get used to how heavy it was on my wrist. I love the way the watch fits my wrist and the way the band feels next too my skin. I\\x92ve had it a few weeks and really haven\\x92t tried all the apps available. Love it! I bought this for the heart rate monitor for my heart condition. other than not being a constant monitor it\\'s amazing! Battery life can be drained a little faster than id like but with that new fast-charging thing apple does it\\'s not too much of a drag down. It did NOT come with a block, only the cord. Watch paired nicely. It was very easy to set up. Unfortunately, the watchband does not work well. It falls off about every half hour to hour, whether I\\x92m sitting or walking. I usually do not have anything in my hand that could possibly pull at it. I am not sure why it doesn\\x92t work well. Also, you have to buy a cord/or correct plug to be able to charge it, which is not optimal. I guess I have to buy a new band, as well. Even though it has and support lots of useful features but one thing I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nWhen Garmin and Fitbit can come up with 5 to 12 days battery life, why Apple can not. This is the only thing which regrets every buyer after buying an expansive watch. Starlight color is striking! Really like the night breathing and ECG features. Favorite faces are the Solar Graph which shows the sun\\'s position in the sky all during the day and night, and Astronomy, which shows the sunlight moving across the earth. The sleep feature is not as good as the Fitbit\\'s and wish it was better. This watch looks nice on the wrist. The 41mm is large enough to read without being too large on a small wrist. Sleeker, better connected, more efficiently charged, faster, more intuitively organized and managed than ever before. The single greatest advance among my repertoire of uses is its connectivity with messaging\\x97I just don\\'t miss messages anymore; of course, I can put them off or ignore them whenever that\\'s best but even that is more easily handled. And next is the music I can now store on it, which is easily accomplished and saves me taking my phone to the gym where I was forever misplacing it. And next is the improvement in ease and accuracy of the ECG recording of heart rhythm; I\\'m nearly 80, so knowing I am or am not in atrial fibrillation is important to me on occasion, which does not come up for me everyday, but when it does I want the watch to work, to do its thing; and now it does. I am grateful. I could go on (and on), but I won\\'t. If you have need, and means, buy it. Really love the watch and use it every day, especially in my profession. I didnt understand everything about it at first but it is a perfect fit! Best Play Video\\n\\xa0Good watch, comfortable and easy configuration. It\\x92s a good watch A few friends had these watches and I became intrigued. I bought one and now it is a permanent part of my arm or so it seems. My only complaint is I wish the battery life was longer but that is a very small minus. It arrived the same day of purchase which was such a plus. Good job Amazon! I love my new watch! Great price with employee discount. Birthday gift for my wife, she had a series 3 previously and loves her upgrade. Two fer for dad, wife gave series 3 to daughter and she loves it too. #WIN This watch is WILD looks so good and premium,it came brand new sealed loving it!\\nso far I can\\x92t say nothing bad on it for what I\\x92ve been reading people saying battery it\\x92s not so good but we\\x92ll see! I use it to ping my phone if I ever lose track of it and it\\x92s nice to use for music controls. Very happy with my purchase so far. This is my first piece of wearable tech. I chose the Apple Watch because I\\'m an iPhone user and have faith in Apple products due to their simplicity, aesthetics, cutting edge technology, durability, product support, and overall value. So far this watch has lived up to all my expectations.\\n\\nIn terms of feature benefits, my main interest are the heart health functions including the Mindfulness/Breath app. The fall detection also seems like good insurance; it will automatically contact 911 in the event of a hard fall.\\n\\nBeyond that, the watch itself is beautiful as a watch, and very convenient from a communication perspective.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s pricing and delivery were great. I am very satisfied. Nothing like ordering a watch that doesn\\x92t work until you go buy a charger. What is up with Apple? I love the fitness tracker and the reminders to stand if I have been too sedentary. The face is easy to read and the notifications are helpful. Once I found the right watch face that didn\\'t eat the battery I can go almost 2 days on a charge. Glad I waited for the 7 series watch, awesome features. Battery life is great! I am happy with my purchase. Play Video Did not really want it. Kids bought it for non tech savvy wife. So cool setting it up that husband bought one as well. So fun seeing my wife setting timers and taking wrist calls while gardening!\\nI would strongly recommend getting the unit with cellular service. It costs about $10 a month to add to your plan. But allows to make and receive calls without phone but moves to phone pairing when close. Why? During workouts or a dirty or inconvenient work like painting or at a lap pool your phone can be secure and protected. Legit Apple watch! Thanks ?? I\\'m no tech nerd, but it literally took me 10 mins to set up. I already have a USB C plug, if you have the latest iPhone or iPad, then you should already have this. If you have the latest phone, then it should already be updated, but if you don\\'t, make sure to update your phone before you get the watch. I had the series 3 which I dropped and cracked after 5 reliable years unfortunately, it will cost me almost as much to fix so I decided to get a new one. Other than a longer battery life and comes on without having to touch it, I don\\'t see much difference in the series 7. Very useful and resistant I got one for Christmas so I wanted to get my daughter one for her birthday. She absolutely loves it like I do. Love getting all of my alerts right on my wrist! And I can respond to them! Watch housing looks more black than green (there is a slight tint of green under a bright flashlight, hardly noticeable). Because it looks more black the housing matches with other color watch bands. Other watch housing color options (blue, red and rose gold ) don\\x92t offer the same variety in band choice because of the color. Delivered product fast and product was exactly what we wanted Love it I recommend and you should get one it tracks what I need it to and I got to pick my wallpaper and everything A lot of apps to help your lifestyles! Battery lasts more than a day so no worries about not having a watch working by days end. I especially like the health and exercise monitoring. I resisted at first until my children wanted me to get one for the falling feature. I live alone. It senses if you fall and tries to make you move with vibrations and noise. If you do not respond it calls an emergency number.\\n\\nNow I use it for everything. Even telling time! Great price and fast delivery. Had some issue with charging the watch but Amazon was kind enough to offer exchange Not sure why there was no protective plastic film like apple normally uses. Looks like it was opened before and later resealed with stickers on the edges neatly. Nothing is wrong with my watch that I received thus far, but it would be nice to have some clarification on why mines was not fully sealed. Also I didn\\x92t realize that Apple does not include the whole charger set for this watch. I had to order one separately and it took two days through Amazon to arrive so if you plan on using this right away I would get the charger first. I brought this one because Apple Watch series 3 died. Like the bigger screen. Wrist band did not fit my tiny wrists at all. Battery life still sucks. The older I get the more I rely on my Apple Watch to track all my health issues so when I go to the Doctor I have a good report of my body to present to him. I can pull my activity counts, average heartrate, run an EKG and more. It even tells him how much I am hydrating. If I take a fall the watch detects and asks if it should call for help, it tells me when I have been watching my televised story programs too long and need to stand up and move, and also tracks how well I am sleeping. The bigger screen on this model is also helpful to my failing eyes. No special likes or dislikes. I think it works as designed. I need to know how to use the apps better, but that is on me I guess. I purchased the cellular watch because I may want to in the future use the cellular part. I am not using that at the moment. But what I want to find out is can I call my 911 people do it even if there\\x92s don\\x92t have a cellular plan can I still use the watch for emergency kind of like any phone will do; Even if the phone is not hooked up to a service. Great product! Satisfies all my needs. I have medical issues and I love all the apps and info it comes with to help with stuff like this. Third Apple Watch. The improvements are nice. Keep masking better! My wife loves it does everything she wants it to Initially, I never wanted a Smart Watch. Then, my husband got one & I thought his was pretty cool. SO I started looking at one similar to what he had (a Fossil), but was unable to find something I liked, or could even tolerate. Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I\\'ve worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I\\'ve had my watch, I\\'ve found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone. And to think that I was so.very.opposed to getting a Smart Watch... Now, I don\\'t know how I ever got by without it. I ordered this for my wife. It came when it was supposed too. I didn\\'t read everything about the watch, the charge base has a type C plug on it and did not come with a wall plug, so I had to buy 1. Other than the plug it is a great product. You can\\x92t go wrong with Apple Watch. Only dislike is that the 7 series requires a different wall plug end. I had to order it separately Cuando compre y vi comentarios negativos lo pensé dos veces para comprarlo pero me arriesgue y lo compre, personalmente digo que me arriesgue porque soy de Ecuador y no tenia como devolver o hacer reclamos ya que no me encuentro en estados unidos, pero me llego sellado, original con numero de serie original de apple lo he utilizado y es muy bueno producto me gusto el color. Lo unica duda es porque en los comentario negativos personas mencionaban que les había llegado abierto o incluso solo les habían llegado la caja vacía, en lo personal me llego bien 10/10 sin ninguna novedad Only had this watch for a couple days, but I\\x92m amazed at how much it does! I\\x92m not sure it measures sleep quality, but that is the only thing it may not do, and maybe it does that too and I haven\\x92t found it yet. So far I love it, and with the super fast charging speed with a 20 watt usb c, charging is not an issue I bought this watch because of a need to\\nMonitor my heart and heart rate. Also to have\\nQuicker access to other information I need.\\nMy Dr also recommended I buy this watch with\\nIt\\x92s ECG capability. It has performed so well\\nIn all areas and gives me a new piece of mind.\\nIt is very comfortable also. I do not swim with it or sleep with it. Very happy. The watch is amazing love everything about it I\\x92ve always been a smart watch user, however, being that I recently converted to Apple after finding that I enjoy their products and software, I needed a new watch.\\n\\nThis product is beautiful. The screen is high resolution, it\\x92s fast, and you can seamlessly transfer between phone and watch. The screen is small, but it displays a lot more information at once than I really expected it to, so using it isn\\x92t a headache.\\n\\nI love the utility. Everything you think a smart watch should do, this watch CAN do. From needing a calculator, to switching your songs, tracking your activity & workouts- basing the calories burned on your heart rate. I exercise a lot and appreciate the information smart watches can bring. You can text, call, read emails, make payments. Etc.\\n\\nThe only issue I have with the watch is an issue I have with apple products in general- if you\\x92re like me and this is your first apple watch- you\\x92re probably going to have to watch a tutorial or two in order to know how to turn it on, and to know what this watch can really do for you. Apple does offer \\x93helpful tips\\x94 but those tips aren\\x92t really comprehensive as to how to use your watch. I probably still don\\x92t know all I can do with it, which is cool, but frustrating. Like it The watch has all good features to help with staying in touch with your health habits and contacts. Shipping from seller was slow, but that the way life is now. I love the watch but the short battery life makes it hard to go any time without a charger. I guess that is just the way things are with these digital watches so you just have to be prepared. For travel, I bought a portable power bank so I can charge the watch when I am traveling. Best watch you can ever buy I wanted to upgrade my Apple Watch that was 4+ years old. Awesome larger watch face. Does everything the old one did, with some extras. Love it I recently purchased an Apple Watch series 7 to replace my series 4. I love my Apple Watch. I love that I can make and receive calls and texts without having to have my phone with me. I love having all my apps with me as well. I got this on a deal and it works great. A more prominent display feels good. This has everything I need in a regular watch, plus a lot of features. This watch is fun to use, I use it to track my exercise, sleep, heart, breathing. It\\'s an excellent health monitor too. Buy this watch and you\\'ll be impressed with the technology. Gotta recommend it. My wife had a 3 and I surprised her with a 7. She looooooves it. However. If you use Skribble. Its not easily found. But it IS in there just scroll down to the botton of your new text and click it. I have the six. Bought this for my wife. Mine has caught a fib three times which I printed out ecg and sent to my cardiologist. My wife likes the activity app mostly. Prefer apple due to iPhones the watches sync well. Can\\x92t go wrong with apples quality I bought this for my dad as a way to get a hold of me when he falls and needs help up. So far it works. Easy to use. Works superbly with iphone Replaced a Series 2 with this Series 7 AppleWatch and I am blown away by the updates to the functionality of the current watch. Such a fabulous product, and was really impressed with the cost on Amazon. I thought I\\'d need to wait for a major holiday or the Series 8 to be released before there would be a discount....not at all! The blue color is gorgeous and such a wonderful addition to the usual black, space gray, etc. I am totally satisfied with the Series 7 AppleWatch! I\\x92ve had it now for a couple months AND I LOVE IT???? It great absolutely perfect ?? Definitely recommend?? Thank you Open box issue had no effect on the product. The watch arrived as expected with no imperfection or defects. Updated with Apple iOS to the latest firmware and boom! You have yourself a brand new series 7 Apple Watch and you saved some money. I hope this helps. I\\'m sure this works very well, I realized (too late) that the watch I want is the one with fall notification and more health information, and facial recognition. The problem is how to order the one I want. For the wife and she loves it I finally got the watch and I like it for the most part. I like the reminders to get up and move very so often. I like the interface and functionality. The only thing I am disappointed about is the battery life. I expected it to last several days. It barely lasts two days. The charging cord supplied does NOT fit any charger I have. I love everything apple. Great watch! Highly recommend it for all people apple!! It\\x92s a great little gadget and I bet I will get even more use out of it as I become more active. I love the Astronomy watch face of the Earth. I do wish the default wristband was better attached though. I had to buy myself an after market band because the one it came with didn\\x92t attach very securely and there were times where I unclipped it from my wrist and it fell to the floor. Luckily no damage. But for ~ ~$400 Watch you\\x92d think it would be more secure. I\\x92m unable to review any part of the watch due to the fact that it doesn\\x92t come with a charger adapter, which I think is a little ridiculous considering people spend hundreds of dollars to buy the watch that comes with everything but a way to charge it to test if we would like it or not and on top it off the fact that none of the older model charging stations work with them either. I\\x92m just a little disappointed because I\\x92ve waited about a week and a half or so for this watch and I can\\x92t even wear it until I can buy the USB adapter for it. So happy with my new watch -- wish the battery would last a little longer, but otherwise no complaints! So my new watch says the set up instructions are on the watch, but the battery needs to be charged. Pull out the magnetic charging cable, go to plug it in and what??? The cable end is not the standard USB plug that works with any charging block or even your computer. No, it is a type C connector! Good luck finding a type C charger or port in any airport or hotel. Quick trip to the store to lay out some cash buying a new charger cable with USB connection so I can set up my new watch. Really, Apple? You can\\x92t make your stuff compatible with any existing charger in the world? No, you\\x92re special, you charge extra to make your stuff work. Ok good I was a lil hesitant because some reviews had mentioned they were missing stuff and sealed was open but that was not my case got everything brand new and box was sealed. happy camper... I bought this because of the fall detection function which seems to work ok. When I am rough housing with my dog it will occasionally start rattling on my wrist and ask me if I have fallen. So, for that functionality it provides my wife some security which is a good thing.\\n\\nAs a sports watch, it is really maddening. The swim function is difficult to stop when you are done swimming. So much so that I swim an extra lap to make sure my splits in my regular routine are accurate. Today, I couldn\\x92t get the swim function to work at all. It took me to bicycling and would not exit. I just gave up and swam my laps. I think it has to do with the watch getting wet. Funny thing, when you swim the watch gets wet!! I have a Garmin that is flawless in the pool - all of the time, every time. Guess I will have to take it to the pool just to get me laps right.\\n\\nWhen I walk the dogs the gps function seems pretty accurate. Or, at least it is within the range of error of the Garmin. Walking works pretty well but I don\\x92t keep track of splits so time keeping is not terribly important.\\n\\nFor the principal reason to buy this watch, it does the job. For anything else I have used it for it ranges from an F to a C+. I love the watch, battery life is great just put it on the charger every night. I use it for exercising it ll record. I do a lot of communicating thru my watch it\\x92s very convenient with my job. I give it 5 star FOR SURE!! Had the series 3 for to long, I\\x92m glad I upgraded Would like the battery to last longer. I use the health app and heart rate app If your buying this for the blood 02 app . Don\\x92t it\\x92s never right. And most times it won\\x92t even read . Can\\x92t figure out what to do with the sleep app, as I use my watch a lot.!By the time sweet dreams come around my watch is almost exhausted,and thereby needs to be charged ! As expected Very good product Use it everyday. Came oem, beautiful Muy util para todo Bought this for my wife for mother\\'s day, she really likes it. Battery life seems good, most of the apps work great (facetime doesn\\'t work with it) neither does snap chat. Different color bands and watch covers are available at a very low price! I purchased 7 differnt color bands and 10 different color watch covers. Girlfriend love and enjoy it Great looking time piece but for the money the battery life is terrible, didn\\x92t even get a full day no matter what settings I tried With cellular this thing beats every other watch I\\'ve ever had. Lightweight, comfortable with just the standard band. i purchased other traditional leather bands and went back to Apple\\'s basic band. Options in using apps had changed how a watch can work for you. I seldom use my phone, as this watch does everything. Couldn\\'t ask for improvements, but sure Apple will develop solutions I haven\\'t even thought of, and upgrade my watch. Real useful watch, not just a timepiece. I upgraded from a series 1 and love this! I can actually see the screen better so the quality is great. Seems durable but I would get a screen protector to avoid scratches. I think the battery life has stayed pretty steady and Watch came brand new despite a few reviews saying some of theirs was used. Everything came as described! It updated quickly and easily! Didn\\x92t take more than 20 minutes if your iPhone is already updated. Highly satisfied!! None too pleased about a couple things: Made in China, and didn\\x92t come with a USB-C charging block. I happen to be temporarily staying near my parents\\x92 home in the middle of nowhere where I can\\x92t just drive down the road to pick one up, which means I have to drive 30 miles and it\\x92s continually snowing here with bad roads or order one and wait. When you\\x92re from Atlanta and have everything at your fingertips, this sort of frustration should not be encountered, particularly when dealing with Apple. We Apple buyers have grown accustomed to the finer details and Apple cheaping out leaving us inconvenienced like this is extremely the wrong move by Apple. For me, it\\x92s not about the cost to go buy a $10 USB-C block, it\\x92s the inconvenience and hassle it poses me that I have to drive 30 miles one way in the stupid snow to do it. Geeze. Now my pretty new watch sits here dead. I don\\'t wear a watch. I only wore Fitbit for exercise time. But then I bought iPhone13 and wanted to join the rest of the world ;) so I got the 7 series watch! And boy do I love it! This thing reminds me of every spy movie and every old space-themed cartoon I watched! The charger makes this purchase worth it.\\nAfter all the gimmicks that apple can sell you, the charger is where it is at. You can charge this thing very fast and hence you are basically able to wear it all the time. it maybe takes 30 mins to charge it. The EKG is okay, it only gives you lead 2 (from my testing). It is somewhat accurate but the read-out AI read EKG will always give you sinus rhythm. O2 sats are accurate and everything else is similar to that of the previous model. Love this watch. Only two detractors kept it from getting all 5 stars. One had to wait to change the watch for several days since it did not come with a usb-c plug in. Two was there were no directions on how to hook the band. I have never had anything like the one that came with it and I put it on wrong and it kept falling off. Thank heavens I have a young niece to explain how to use it. Play Video\\n\\xa0Everything is good but battery. I use this watch with cellular connection when walking, biking, camping.\\nI changed the band to a larger more tactical looking band, as i am used to a larger watch.\\nI liked it so much we bought 2 for myself and my Girlfriend\\x85She loves hers as well!\\nVery satisfied and would recommend it to anyone looking for a apple watch i haven\\'t quite learned all the features available on my Apple watch, but I\\'m learning a little more each day. I\\'m not too pleased with the battery life, but I attach the watch to the charge each day and all\\'s good. Love my watch it is amazing I\\x92m very happy with this purchase. It does have sleep tracking. I charge my battery while getting ready for bed and usually it\\x92s charged and ready for another 24 hours of wear time within 30min of charging. I am very happy with all the features this watch has to offer. I am enjoying this watch so much. It was very easy to pair with my phone. When I am driving I don\\x92t have to try and find my phone in my purse, I just look at my watch. Because this is new to me I am sure I will find more fun things my watch can do. Wish the batter would last a little longer. Does have a quick charge but the charger doesn\\x92t even come with the product. And of course there is yet another special plug to charge this that will not fit your apple phone charger so that\\x92s a bit frustrating. But overall product really is great. Use it every day. I just became an Apple Watch /iPhone owner. The watch came super fast. The keyboard is a little harder to type on compared to the galaxy classic 4. Overall great product. The watch disconnects from my phone constantly. Screen goes in and out. Doesn\\'t notify when I get text. Play Video Just opened it today so I don\\'t know anything about the sleep function yet. And it will be a couple of days before I find out, because when it arrived it was only 54% charged and it has progressively lost the charge and now I\\'m down to 15% and just discovered I can\\'t charge it. I have to go out and purchase another charger instead of them making it a usual USB. Ridiculous. Expensive watch and Apple can\\'t be cordial enough to make all of their items work together?!? This Apple Watch usually last a day and half until it needs to be charged again. But I absolutely love it! You can do so much with it, and it\\x92s definitely worth buying The watch itself is perfectly fine and works as expected. Ordered the green since it\\x92s my favorite color and you really cannot tell the watch aluminum casing is green. Unless under just the right light. Wish I had seen in person before ordering. Love this watch Very nice watch and does a lot of stuff. I\\x92m still getting to know how it works, however, so far very good! I had previously ordered this watch, but the box came empty, I decided to give it another go and success! Yay! It all came this time! It is a beautiful watch with tons of health features. I am looking forward to exploring more! This is my very 1st apple watch and so I got the GPS version because I did not know if I would like it or not or really use it and now, I\\'m happy I ordered This!\\nI find myself using this for everything now and almost never take my phone out of my pocket when I am out on the go I can read all my Facebook messages and my text messages form the watch! although one thing I don\\'t like is that when I get the message it pops up the message on the watch as soon as I get it so others can read it if you don\\'t look right away and read or clear it from notifications think it may be a setting or something that could be fixed with an update but have not really looked at all the settings on the watch yet just used it as is after setting up. I love that it always stays on, the band does not slip around your arm/wrist, the larger screen, ECG function and so much more!!! It\\'s the greatest! I had an Apple watch years ago and I thought I remembered the battery life being a lot better than this one. Aside from that is fine. Works with my other Apple devices as it should. Buen producto, buen vendedor I upgraded from a second-generation model to this one. I dislike that you have to pay so much more to get one with the Milanese loop band and have to get a cellular model to get the dark color. This basically does nothing more than the ones that are several hundred dollars but are about twice the price. That is the negative. On the positive side, I like the always-on display, the EKG function, and the larger display. I look forward to a time when these become thinner and have longer battery life. I would buy it again. My son loves it and we added a subscription to our cell phone carrier. He doesn\\'t take his phone when he goes out and still able to text and make and receive calls. He\\'s Happy with it. After spending $800 for this thing, I had to spend another $20 to get a USB-C charger cube. I must have 20 USB-A cubes, but this is not compatible. Of all the zillion devices I have, none need a USB-C female charging outlet. I understand why USB-C is needed, but not to include a charger cube?\\n\\nWith the battery arriving DOA, I had to charge it from my laptop which was not very convenient since my laptop USB-C port is used for several other purposes.\\n\\nThey must have saved $2. Oh ... add it right to the bottom line.\\n\\nThere are also no instructions included whatsoever.\\n\\nWhat a bad first impression.\\n\\nSetup took over two hours with required updates, downloads, authorizations, pairings, log-ins, etc. I suppose a lengthy setup is understandable ... but did I mention no charger and no instructions? I\\'m not likely to get over that. Really ... how cheap can you get Apple?\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that I got a 31 page printed manual along with my Apple branded USB-C charger cube I had to order, but absolutely nothing along with my watch!!\\n\\nHow cheap can you get Apple? How cheap can you get?\\n\\nIt\\'s an amazing device, but products that don\\'t present themselves well when opening the box are doomed to failure in the market. I am both upset with and shocked at Apple for this.\\n\\n3 stars is all you get. All the incredible engineering that went into this was lost on me immediately by the decisions made by some idiot product/marketing manager.\\n\\nI am soooo done with Apple products. Ok yes it\\x92s a nice watch but it Scratches very easily I think it\\x92s very overpriced for what your getting also battery last all day but cheaper watches last multiple days apple can do better it\\x92s a good watch tho Overall the watch is pretty useful, it took about an hour to charge up and after that the set up was seamless and fast. Llegó todo Perfecto, la caja estaba un poco sucia pero lo de adentro es lo que importa ?? Coming from a Series 3, this was a huge improvement. I\\x92d honestly recommend anyone debating on spending the extra money to get this over the \\x93still in production for some reason\\x94 3rd gen Apple Watch. With the extra screen real estate it\\x92s much you actually get a full keyboard and won\\x92t strain your eyes trying to read notifications on it. I love this new IWatch 7 this is my third IWatch. Only disappointment is that the charger cable does not come with a way to plug it into AC. You have to buy the AC adapter for the cable or plug it into your IMac. The first two came with the AC adapter. I would rather charge the watch this way in my charging station. I know it is just another way for Apple to save some money but come on, lets not get too cheap! I really like the new Apple Watch 7 series. The screen (though only 1 mm bigger\" seems much larger and clearer. I have not yet tried the sleep tracking function as the one time I slept with the watch on the \"protective case\" I bought for it cracked (see my other review on that). The watch offers several notable upgrades from the 5 series and the clarity and readability of the screen alone are worth it when it is time to upgrade or your old watch gives out. Still figuring out how to use it. I bought it for the exercise apps to track my steps and count calories as I move. I expected longer battery life;) I use this watch for daily monitoring of my blood pressure and as an alert in the case that I would lose my balance and fall. It also is capable of answering phone calls when I don\\x92t have my phone close at hand. Great, I loved it!! But the bracelet is not secure it has already fallen off my wrist twice\\x85?? Nice product, just Apple is too cheap to put an adapter in package to charge the watch\\x85 additional purchase required! ?? I love it :) i have a garmin fenix 6x pro and this watch :) i use my garmin for more advanced sport activities while my apple watch is my daily watch :) i wish apple spends more time to make the battery life longer :) but as it is now it is acceptable and nothing more :) the watch is comfy and light to wear. Wonderful display and really helps me on my journey to lose weight while tracking all my activities I really like the Apple Watch Series 7 45mm size. It\\x92s not too big at all. Upgraded from Series 4, 40mm and I couldn\\x92t justify going to the 41mm size. Had to get it when Amazon had it for $50 off regular price. So happy I got the Midnight color. I use the sleep feature as well as the Blood oxygen function and ECG. Using the Health App is easy and tracks many important activities. Absolutely No regrets with this purchase. Highly recommend. Thank you Amazon. I\\x92ve used this watch since 2020 or a version of it and twice no make that three times it is detected a fib which now I know I have due to the watch being able to detect this thing is literally a lifesaver. ???? I received the watch I ordered but I didn\\x92t realize the charging cord was a usb-c. Why would it be that?? I also didn\\x92t realize that the bands included would not fit my wrist size. On the longest notch it is too small. So i had to buy a 25 dollar usb-c outlet and a 35 dollar extra large (8-9) inch band. Kinda disappointed. I have used several smart watches from different brands and this was the most expensive one but didn\\x92t bring me any surprise. The response speed was slow sometimes and it failed to test blood oxygen quite frequently. And it was out of battery when being delivered. It took more than an hour to be able to turn on the device, not 15 mins as described on Amazon page. Not worth the money. Considering if I should return it. Beautiful watch I have gone through I can\\x92t even tell you how many fitbits in the past few years. I had taken good care of them too, but technical errors got the best of it. I thought I\\x92d give apple a try and I\\x92m so happy I did! I love being able to get notifications on my watch and reply to texts. Definitely something to get used to but I wouldn\\x92t go back to Fitbit after this purchase. It was too small for my wrist to had to return it and get the 45mm The feature that i find most useful is the tracking of calories burnt. It is connected to iphone and all the messages and notifications can be seen and replied to on the phone. The blue dial and strap looks so good. A must have gadget if you have iphone. Replaces Fitbit. much better Excelente producto, la baja sellada y en perfectas condiciones I have 3 Apple Watches (each a different Series) & love them all. I don\\x92t use it for things like sleep tracking but since I\\x92ve owned them I don\\x92t wear any other watches. Upgraded from the 3 and I am so glad I did I bought it to track water aerobics steps. Love the heart and oxygen monitor and phone Magnetic band has fall off my wrist 3x. Thank goodness I had a protector on the face. Now I have to buy another band, such a waste of money. I\\x92ve seen others state this issue as well. Bought this after using a Fitbit Charge 4 for a couple months. Upgraded to this and I can\\'t go back. If you\\'re in the Apple ecosystem and need some simple health monitoring I absolutely recommend this. I do miss the battery life of the simpler Fitbit though. I love it ! Very easy to set up. Can view everything with ease. Received in a couple days. I like everything about it. Big jump from series 1 to this. Much bigger face. I could text without my glasses if I had too.\\nMost important: for the price($70 less than Apple) I was concerned it was gonna come renewed even thought it didn\\'t indicate it. Based on the packaging it definitely came new.\\nI would buy it again via Amazon. I really wanted an apple watch, i did my homework. It was exactly what i thought i was getting. My only negative is the battery life. i would love to take advantage of the sleep settings, but it does need to be charged everyday. But i\\'m okay with charging it at night There is a definite learning curve. If you get one I recommend loading one app at a time so you know what is going on. Somehow I loaded everything that was available (because it was on my phone) and I do not know why the watch is doing half of the things it does. I just upgraded from a S3, and to be honest I have a hard time finding the improvements. The screen, because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side, looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that wasn\\x92t designed for your system. But you\\x92re not, it\\x92s Apple. The ECG system is honestly the only reason I bought the watch and love that feature. If you don\\x92t need the ECG, stay with the SE or S6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges. It is what it is u spend the money u get a good item Cool looking device wishe they should support what\\x92s WhatsApp I have always rocked Fitbit and now I\\x92m hooked to Apple, plus I think it does a better job of tracking ateps I absolutely love my watch. The screen display is perfection and the band is beautiful. It does not come with a power brick, however that has been the case for awhile now and I guess people just haven\\x92t read the description. Having multiple apple products I already understood that this would be the case. Battery lasts much longer than my previous 3 and I cannot get over how beautiful the screen is now. Follow me @simply.sena for finds! The straps are fire, the quality is good, worth the money, I walk all day and rejoice :) Love my new clock. I\\x92m upgrading from a series 1, so it is a completely different watch. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since I paid for the watch, so I should get access to all the features. Nonetheless, I really like the starlight Apple Watch and band. It\\x92s very subtle and nice to look at. Hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc I really would like one. It is a pain that they don\\'t give power bricks, but this is the new age. I highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c. Anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them. Everything works great with this watch it\\x92s accurate I use it it\\x92s motivating me to exercise more It turned out to be the perfect gift for her.. One would think that Apple, of all chargeable watches on the market, would stay charged for at least 5-6 days. My old Fitbit was good for a week without charging. That is the only knock I have on this watch, otherwise it is beyond expectations. If you want Save money buy it?? I love having the security the Apple Watch with GPS and cellular which is very inexpensive to hav my This watch makes it easy to call for help. Hopefully if you fall you remain conscious enough to make the call as series 7 makes emergency calls very easy. I would definitely recommend an Apple Watch with GPS and cellular for anyone. The watch is very comfortable to wear, I haven\\x92t worn a watch since I was a teenager. The fitness reminders and features have really helped me to focus on keeping fit. Love the ease of use with iPhone and air pods. Love this watch. Usually can get 2 days on a full charge, even glancing at it about 150+ times a day. Also charges super fast with a macbook 30w adapter. Probably would be faster on the bigger adapters but I didn\\'t want to burn the watch battery awesome watch, I\\x92ve always had the aluminum version but thought I\\x92d give the stainless a try and love it and it goes with anything clothes wise! Love the always on large display. swipe text works great. Beautiful images on screen.\\nBattery doesn\\x92t last as long as my 3 but I charge every night anyway. Can\\x92t judge sleep function because it\\x92s on charger every night. FANTASTIC PRICE! Ok Great addition to the iPhone. I came from a series 3 and it is a huge jump. The battery life could be better with always on display but you can disable it. This froze up at 2:10 it is currently 5:01 it won\\x92t do anything this is the second time this happened it is getting aggravating I love this watch! Does everything I want it to do but I do wish the battery life was better. You will get about a day and a half out of it....possibly 2 days. I will say it charges very fast, only about an hour so that is a positive. Really like the slightly bigger size. Play Video\\n\\xa0Es el original q vende apple. Ahora viene sin el cubo. Y la entrada es tipo C\\nVIENE SELLADO. NUEVO. NO DUDES EN PEDIRLO Bought this for my birthday. I had boughten a $30 dollar fitness watch that I had for over a year. It didn\\x92t track my steps nearly as good as the Apple Watch did. This Apple Watch is amazing. It\\x92s easy to read. Links up to my phone super easy. I am very glad with this purchase. Love this watch. It is the only one I wear even though I have many others. The functions and apps are spot on. Really like the always on screen. Sometimes Siri gets to talk to me even though one does not have to say \"Hey Siri\". Sometimes this is a tiny bit intrusive. All in all I\\'m totally impressed and think this is well worth the price I debated Apple watches for a long time but enjoyed the features of my various models of Fitbit that I wore for a decade+. When Fitbit recalled my latest model because of explosion fears, I made the switch to Apple. It\\'s easy to use and the integration with my phone is outstanding. I just wish the battery lasted more than one day. After contacting the chat feature for support, I was told to reset the watch to improve the battery performance. It did not. I am charging it twice per day. I really like it otherwise. If someone can help me, please let me know. my boyfriend loves this apple watch. it\\x92s the best apple watch. it works perfectly fine and no problems what so ever. i recommend this for anyone and it came early. Excelente cumplió todas las expectativas. Y llego súper rapido I almost had the same issue with Verizon not supporting this watch. The Verizon store told me it was not compatible and that it was defective Amazon gave me the runaround as well as Apple. I logged into the Apple Watch app and was able to activate it there on Verizon Only thing I really dislike is having to charge every day. Will have to work into routine such as charging when having morning coffee , or shower time. It doesn\\x92t take too long to charge thankfully I\\'m sure everyone agrees, but I also love the Apple Watch 7. Especially, when playing golf, it is very convenient to use as a distance meter. I highly recommend it to those who want to buy it. My Apple Watch will not work with my cellular phone they told me I I need a LTE Apple Watch phone it is not comparableto my phone please dyne the correct Apple Watch I had an older one (almost 5 years old!) and so I knew I would love it. With this one I got a bigger screen. Totally worth it! ??\\nEverything about the new one is great!!\\nIf you are thinking about one. Trust me it\\x92s worth it!\\nI use it for the workout features and keeping me from sitting too much. Also to set timers and reminders. Leave your phone in the other room? No problem!! Text from your watch! Talk on the phone too! It\\x92s like an 70s kid is now in the Jetson\\x92s!!! ?????? Like a lot of Apple products, this product is also exclusive in the hacked watch market. Lots of companies that offer watches, albeit at better prices but without a good price, which is not the case. This watch is a bit expensive but very affordable for those who have an iPhone. It just completes the little holes that the iPhone does not cover for us. For those who have a pacemaker it is recommended to consult a doctor It was a 41 mm and I wanted bigger. I accidentally hit my watch a few times against the wall on the corners and really thought I broke it but nothing On this model, at least, you need a charging brick with a female USB-C connection, which we don\\'t have in the house. Now I need to go buy one before the watch runs out of juice. Apple\\'s claim is that they\\'re reducing waste, but it would reduce waste even more if they didn\\'t ship the watch in a box the size of my forearm. This is a cop-out. They\\'re just trying to save a dime.\\nOtherwise, no complaints so far. Setup was pretty easy, no issues with pairing or adding apps. Tested out the Ekg function, O2 sensor, compass, phone finder, etc. Functionality is good, pretty cool features. Looking forward to taking it for trail runs once I can get it charged. This thing stays charged for a matter of hours. Terrible It was a bday gift for my bfriend and he loves that! A+++ I turned off the always-on as I could barely make it through the day. Now I use around 50% for 24 hours.\\n\\nWish I would have spent the extra $100 and gotten the sim enabled. Fast set up, had to upgrade my phone but that was no problem. Took about 40 minutes, bought the USB C charger after reading the reviews but luckily my iMac at work had the connection so I charged it on that until I received the charger. With Verizon I connected the cellular in about 10 minutes through the app. $30 activation fee and $10 a month. The watch is in great condition, I also ordered a case to keep it protected. I\\x92m really happy with my order! I also Afterpay\\x92d this and I\\x92m onto my 2nd payment. 5 star experience fast shipping and battery life last long when you turn off the \\x93always on\\x94 option. I upgraded from a series 3 and so far I\\x92m really happy with my purchase I got one for myself and liked it so much I had to buy one for my friend too.\\nShipped on time.\\nLove it I was worried it might be too big! It\\'s perfect!\\nI have a small wrist and the 45mm was the perfect size for me. My wrist measures 6.5 inches. So what\\x92s the point in paying all of this money for a watch that doesn\\x92t even last a full 8 hour work shift for me? I\\x92ve turned off the \\x93always on display\\x94 and even set it so it doesn\\x92t turn on without me touching it. My watch dies around 8 hours. I charge it every night. It only lasted 7 hours yesterday and last week it only lasted 5.\\nI feel like it was a waste of money. So far I like the watch,not real crazy on the watch band,will see what hot humid weather does,don\\x92t think it will breath real well Awesome product from Apple! First time to have an Apple watch, love it!\\n\\nUsing this to keep track of my physical\\nactivities. My first Apple Watch didn\\x92t disappoint @ all. So I bought a new one, and loving it. I highly recommend buying 45mm. It does everything I need it to.'"

       "'I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch I am a former diehard Fitbit user and I never ever wanted an Apple Watch My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price Sure it had annoying quirks and shortcomings but it counted my steps told me my heart rate every min of every day and it tracked my sleep Well when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window I HATED it 15 days of battery life Gross And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face You know what It doesnt work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long collecting your info and doing who knows what with it You know what else You are still getting steps in even if you cant see the count 247 Who knew I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving My next battle came with my workouts The first few days everything worked great although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts The total vs active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering I looked online and could find nothing about this issue so I ended up calling Apple PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phones date settings to get more livesDONT Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness We did a hard reset and it all worked again I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage Apple should be ashamed Fitbit blows them out of the water there but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts Nope I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting andor double counting my step and exercise calorie burn I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active not total calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness That being said Ive been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs for well over a year and now I know why After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts Ive dropped 15 lbs I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals And from there my love for my Apple Watch bloomed\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it The sleep metrics are so bad that I really dont mind charging it while I sleep The workout stats are great and I like that I dont have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit dont judge I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head And most of all I have learned to love the activity rings I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day tethered to my desk More importantly all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit I am very pleased with my purchase I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone I want to be AWAY from my phone I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user I recommend you give it a go I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost 1000 plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25 discount on Prime Day Plus the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need Things like maps for golf courses maps of terrain and state parks stuff like that I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower but might be fun to do The app counts calories heart rate time etc I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running cycling etc probably all count the same kinds of things I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone so if you\\x92re the same it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something My fitness tracker was about 7 years old and they didnt make that one anymore And it was getting flaky So it was time for a new watch\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one because I do have smaller wrists and I dont like a large clunky watch This one is perfectly sized for me I would have liked the bigger screen but I wouldnt have wanted to wear it so this was the one\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work Then setup of the watch also took quite a while After setting it up I wasnt that impressed Yes it was comfortable but it seemed like just a watch That only lasted a day or two Now I just love this thing\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it It took me a while to find a face that felt natural along with the complications on it I liked Just FYI Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face Stuff like weather times the fitness app And once you get them how you want to work with them they are handy\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking and I liked that It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up Overall I like the implementation of it\\n\\nChasing the rings  Hey this was cool I setup the fitness goals on the watch and one day I just took a walk in the woods 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said Hey it looks like youre working out and asked me what I was doing It seemed to know I was walking and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors I responded and continued my walk in the woods At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it like my heartbeat rate how far I walked how long I was walking really just the details Im a bit of a nerd and I thought it was awesome I also closed my green ring for the day I like it\\n\\nIts an expensive watch but it is also a very cool watch So far I like it a lot\\n\\nDurability   My last watch lasted 7 years Will this one I dont know Only time can tell that So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other I love apple products I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s This watch is really great If you are interested in making health changes and workout changes to improve overall fitnesshealth this watch is for you I have had Fitbit since 2009 I have been a loyal customer I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro iPad iPod and iPhone I love this watch The health breakdown is incredible It is so detailed It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about For example walking stability or walking asymmetry Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry It links to the health app in the iPhone In there everything is broken down It has pushed me to exercise more I am a video gamer This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score If you game you know how addicting that challenge can be I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life The battery life is pretty bad I have to charge it every day Do not let that impact your decision to buy this Since that is the only flaw I have found with the watch I give this product 5 stars Also beware that this does not come with the plug adapter It comes with the charging cord I guess Apple no longer includes the plugs with their products they only include the cord I am very happy with this purchase I have retired my Fitbit completely I was pretty sedentary until I purchased this watch If you love Apple and you want to change your healthworkout patterns get this watch There are so many cool apps to get to track other things you might want to track I got this on prime day so the price was a lower Overall the money you spend on this is well worth it I got the GPSCellular You do have to take the watch to your mobile carrier to set up the cellular It is swim proof and water aerobic proof As usual Apple prevails I also like that this is a super user friendly device as are all Apple products that I have ever used If you want to track sleep there are multiple apps to track it so do not let that deter you from buying this Also Apple has great customer service They are available online or on the phone 247 I hope everyone who buys this enjoys this as much as I do Thank you Amazon and thank you Apple Initially my husband and I bought our Apple Watches from the Apple store 10 days before Amazon prime day We had 4 days until the return window closes so when I saw it\\x92s on sale for 120 less each total of 260tax included I decided to return the ones we bought from Apple store and buy these ones on Amazon\\nMy husband was adamant to buy it from Amazon especially after reading all kinds of reviews about how people got empty boxes or bad watches\\nEventually we bought the watches and we are so glad we took the chance We got everything that came with the watches and there was no sign that the package has been messed with The only complaint I have is that there is a little tear on the box I keep all my Apple products boxes so I need all my boxes to look a certain way lol\\nOverall our watches are great Charges super fast and battery life is great Make sure to turn off \\x93always on Apple Watch face\\x94 to maximize the battery power\\nNot saying the bad reviews are lies but with Amazon and any other online stores it\\x92s always a risk you\\x92re taking the moment you click add to cart and buy it now\\nBuy it if it\\x92s on sale return it if it doesn\\x92t work for you I\\x92d wanted a Watch for years then noticed Amazon offered the basic Series 7 GPS 41mm in green for 284 on Prime Day I thought about it overnight while I did a bit of research\\n\\nThe Series 7 has been out a while but apparently the coming Series 8 will not see a major functional upgrade beyond outward design It\\x92s expected to have the same battery SoC and sensors all packed in a flatter rather lessrounded case of similar size\\n\\nMost users purchasing through Amazon report original equipment in new condition Sure there\\x92s always going to be an unfortunate few who receive a factory defective product but at this price I was willing to risk the time and potential headache of exchange or refund I purchased it without difficulty and received it within a few days Upon unboxing all packaging components and accessories were pristine and in perfect working order\\n\\nAdmittedly I danced a happy little jig around my table as I realized for once things actually turned out in my favor\\n\\nIn the last few weeks of wearing it each day I appreciate its many capabilities Though I do presume none are here to read how convenient a certain feature remains Yet the main point I\\x92ll relay is the realistic expectation of a full day\\x92s battery life I keep it on all day except for the 20 minutes I set it down to charge each afternoon or evening depending on activities I leave the screen alwayson at max brightness and run various tracking control and communication apps continuously Overall it\\x92s helped to make life a little easier These days I\\x92ll take all the help I can get This is my fourth Apple watch I\\x92ve purchased the series 0 series 1 2 two series 4 One stainless one aluminum The 4 is such a great watch I never felt the need to upgrade I recently paid Apple  79 to replace my battery They actually replaced the watch I\\x92ve never had a problem with any Apple watch I purchased the 7 because of a great Amazon price\\n\\nStainless steel vs aluminum Both are great I put one bad scratch on my aluminum crystal It doesn\\x92t affect function and it only shows when the watch is dark It happened when my watch hit the rough edge of our granite countertop My SS has never scratched\\n\\nWhy spend the extra money to get the stainless If you want a GPS only model the SS is  300 more than the aluminum If you want cellular capability the difference drops to  200 Due to health issues my wife convinced me to get the cellular capability In an emergency these will call 911 even when your phone is not around and even when you don\\x92t subscribe for service That\\x92s important\\n\\nThe series 7 has a blood oxygen measurement feature During Covid we purchased two different fingertip devices to measure blood oxygen We were disappointed with both The watch oxygen measurement works seamlessly We consider it worth buying for that feature alone\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIf you want cellular capability spend the extra  200 for SS If you don\\x92t buy the aluminum model and save  300\\nBoth are great watches The color is even more fab in person and the specs on this make my upgrade perfection Ive enjoyed putting the health app feature to its max use FINALLY after all these years of wishingwanting It was easy to set everything up and the features work exactly as advertised making for a great start on keeping track of ALL the things I probably ought to but never had the opportunity beforehand The battery life is great I can get a full charge while I hop in the shower literally after wearing it much of the day  using it to the max with both navigation while driving  my health app as well as for my musicwith my airpods for work the battery hasnt run down on me yet  Ive used it pretty heavily over the past week since it arrived I even got a decent charge using the cord that came with my version 3 I had to wait on a new plug to arrive so I could use the newer version which is even speedier than the older one Moral of the story is either charging cord works great the newer is just faster is all but I didnt find the old one particularly slow by contrast which is great to know I just happily passed down my 3 to my daughter who was delighted to be able to finally have the meditation app for her anxiety  I havent looked back since handing it off My new watch is great the battery lasts  charges speedily AND it has enough room to store all my apps that I want to use unlike my older watch that was constantly maxing out on the simplest of thingsminimal use Im very happy with my upgrade First of all I read many people complain about the charger If you read before you will see exactly what comes with the watch and what you will need I have a old SE iPhone My first step was to install os 15 wish I did with no issues After that was done I paired my watch with no problem I keep the face off and I can go 2 days with no charging and I really use it a lot The alarm is a plus for me Sound is super clear  I can go swimming with no worries and track my exercise The oxygen is another plus for since I have asthma I can keep a track when Im sick I also recommend baying the insurance for a 2 year extended warranty Is not expensive and its really worth it for a 300hundred dollar watch I bought this Apple Watch mainly to track my heart rate and sleep tracking but also for using the wallet feature for opening my college dorm doors that are locked unless ID is presented when I go back to college in a month\\nFrom using the first ever Apple Watch this is definitely a BIG upgrade The screen is very large compared to older models Personally I wish the battery lasted a little longer But the battery does last me about 2 days with always on display turned off Very easy to setup with the Watch app not difficult at all\\nI see so many reviews complaining about the USBC connector as a charger Almost all Apple products use USBC on one end of the cable and I don\\x92t understand why you would complain so much as you should already have one or go and buy one Not a big deal\\nAnother thing to mention Apple doesn\\x92t use the \\x93plastic wrap\\x94 on some of their products and the Apple Watch is one of them Apple does it for environmental reasons No one opened it that is how Amazon and other stores receive them from apple If something is wrong Amazon will help you don\\x92t complain on a review before asking Amazon for help\\nOverall great watch and it was at a great price when purchased Grabbed an official solo loop band from apple and I can barely tell the watch is there Ive wanted an apple watch for a long time to help me with my physical fitness and sleep tracking So when I saw that it was on sale it was finally time to make the purchase I am not disappointed in any way It is simply a fantastic device The fit and finish are beautiful and the functionality is excellent\\n\\nTwo other points that Id suggest a potential buyer keep in mind\\n There is a ton of functionality here and it takes a while to learn Dont be like me and just skip the tutorials They contain good information that will allow a new user to get up to speed more quickly\\n I may get a different wristband The one that comes with my watch tends to pinch my wrist when I exercise and I find myself being distracted by it Im not saying that there is a better option because I havent found one yet But other watches Ive had havent been that way YMMV\\n\\nHope this helps someone After ordering and receiving it today after being delayed I opened it to find the battery is completely dead It\\x92s been charging for a about 20 minutes but still shows the red lightning bolt for needing a charge It is concerning as a dead battery could pose other problems\\nEdited on day 3 Apparently the reserve charge can drain the longer it sits It did take longer than stated to charge but now seems to be working ok My biggest need is to track my heart rate and that is working so far The battery does not last anywhere near as long as my Fitbit and it does need charging before bed in order to track sleep which was another conundrum as it didn\\x92t ask during sleep set up as it should have It did not track sleep the first night despite being set up to do so in the app on my phone so I reset it hoping set up would ask it did not It ultimately did track on night 2\\nOtherwise the green on the band is a little brighter than army green which is nice and the actual watch is more black than green which will enable easier band swapping\\nAfter using a Fitbit for years it will take some getting used to but I am hoping the increased functionality and Apple will give more reliability than the Fitbit which each I had ended up with a warranty replacement in the first year I have been a consumer of Apple products for a very long time When I saw the discounted series 7 Apple watch during Amazon Prime Days I decided it was time to upgrade from my series three I love the added viewing space Going from the 38 to the 41mm screen seems small but somehow Apple made it seem bigger I love the blood oxygen ekg and fall detection features and they work beautifully and easily I am extremely happy with my purchase Now\\x85here\\x92s the downside\\x85\\n\\nThe watch that I purchased through Amazon was defective It seems the sensors were not working The battery also would not hold a charge I spent an hour on the phone with Apple trying to troubleshoot the problem and it was determined that I needed to exchange it Unfortunately since I did not purchase the watch directly from Apple I needed to go through the Amazon return process Apple would service the watch but not exchange it The return through Amazon required more steps than a regular return but it worked and I got my money back It was just a little disappointing to have to wait another week before being able to make the exchange Once my money was refunded I went to Apple and purchased another watch In the future I will purchase Apple products directly from the store to save the extra steps if there is a problem I reserved buying an AppleWatch as I had always used FitBits and my main goal for a while was steps and weight loss I still think if you want a pure pedometer fitbit is better but not by too much The computability with my iPhone makes it an amazing device were I wish I had gotten an Apple Watch a lot sooner I most recently went with a fitbit sense and my wife has a Versa We both had connectivity issues and always needed to have the fitbit app open to be able to sync to the phone This applewatch is always synced which makes it smoother Apps extend to the watch and the battery charges fast I wear my watch all day and if I want to track sleep charge it about an hour before bed and it lasts through the night and the entire next day Everything about this watch is almost perfect The only \\x93bad\\x94 thing about it is the battery life It isn\\x92t terrible but for a 300400 watch it should last for at least 34 days in one charge I can get up to 2 days max in 1 charge\\n\\nDurability is very good I use this watch to workout and all sports However I manage to get a couple of scratches on my watch by accidentally bumping into the wall I recommend to get a screen cover for the watch if your scared of scraping your watch on surfaces or walls\\n\\nBesides those 2 \\x93negatives\\x94 I believe this watch to be the one of if not the best watch for everything IF you have an iPhone\\n\\nI bought the cellular one and it\\x92s very convenient to not need to worry about missed calls if I don\\x92t have my phone with me\\n\\nI also use this watch for Apple Pay and it\\x92s super convenient I just might start leaving my wallet at home lol\\n\\nOverall I think this is a great all around watch\\n\\nPS I don\\x92t recommend to upgrade watches if you have a series 5SE6 I like this watch It\\x92s great but I\\x92m gonna be brutality honest While I enjoy my apple products an can admire that they want to keep it user friendly This watch gives you alot of apps that allows you to work alongside your iPhone It is fun to use and nice to look at Although there are a lot of great things this watch provides I personally believe that there could of been a lot more incorporated in this generation of watch to make it better The battery life is alright I\\x92d give it A 410 it requires a lot of charging if you put it to use which is understandable just a bit frustrating The big one is nice if you have a large arm wrist and fingers The buttons are tiny so they have added a microphone so you can talk into for it either for phone calls or voice chat to text instead of typing If you have the money or want one I\\x92d say why not The more popular they get the better they be sooner at least I\\x92d like to hope As far as a future watch I\\x92d like to see it be thinner while being more comfortable with a better battery life Be creative apple I just don\\x92t want to get cancer form wearing a watch that could give off radiation and give us all cancer I kill watches Over the years every nonname brand jewelry gift inexpensive and expensive has been abused to the death My first thought was I would do that to this one too I hand wash dishes everyday never remember to take it off before I shower and garden and do handy work But I appreciate knowing how much I have walked and being reminded to stand up and take a break getting messages the moment they are sent and not being chained to the phone The medical monitoring works too I am very happy with this device I once thought was silly Glad I bought it When these watches first came out I thought why would I need one of these Well I really still don\\x92t need one but I am sure glad I have it When Amazon had it for 7000 off I said why not I love it and I\\x92m having so much fun with it The only time I take it off is to charge it and with the rapid charger it\\x92s not off for long I keep it on at night because I can\\x92t see my own clock with out my glasses and it has an automatic dimmer so it doesn\\x92t blare in my eyes It keeps track of my steps which I find is way too low I love answering it when you can\\x92t get to your phone in time and when I\\x92m at the grocery store no need to get your phone out at all If people think I\\x92m talking to myself let them it\\x92s all good LOL Last night I used its flashlight and could not believe how bright it was I love changing the faces especially using the one with hand selected pictures from your phone It\\x92s nice to look at your watch and seeing a loved one that has passed smiling up at you There are so many faces to choose from too My husband bought me a Tag Heuer for our 20th anniversary 15 years ago I am I watch person I like to switch watches to go with my outfit or how I am feeling that day With a Tag and that price tag you kind of feel like you have to wear it every day With my Apple Watch and it\\x92s ability to modify in so many different ways I feel like I\\x92m wearing a different one every day I still have my Tag but now only wear it for special occasions Delivery was same day and was excellent The watch I must say is beautiful I chose the Red color and the display is very brilliant There are a lot of apps that you can download Charging time is between an hour and hour and half to full capacity I get a full 2 days with out having to charge it again The band has a nice soft feel to it and sometimes it doesnt feel like I am wearing a watch\\nThe health apps do have some disclaimers so I dont read to much into it For me I call it for entertaining purposes My opinion is the results must me somewhere in the ballpark\\nI have used the sleep app that came with the watch but only allows you to set an alarm I already know Im a poor sleeper I dont think I need an app to tell me that\\nI ride my bike and there is a cool feature that detects that your riding a bike and records the milesspeed and calories I do workout at the gym but it doesnt record the machine Im using or calories I have burned Will need to investigate I have had the watch for nearly a month and I highly recommend it I wasnt going to succumb to the pressure of purchasing an Apple Watch but finally relented I really liked my Garmin except for the size and clunkiness of the design Its served me well for over 7 years Only thing I dont like about the Apple Watch is the short battery life Ive removed almost all tracking functions and I still only get about 24 hrs on a charge I may be doing something wrong but either I charge at night and dont get sleep data or charge during day and dont get motion data Ive owned several pricey fitness watches in the past eg Garmin Polar etc and all of them crapped out at one point or another I considered purchasing higherend models hoping that they would last when I stumbled upon a youtube review by a wonderful German physiologist whatever his profession his analysis and review of several models always ended up with Apple at the top I am not one to promote or support megabusinesses in general as their to be kind unethical means of achieving that status angers me but I have to give credit where credit is due There is nothing I do not love about this watch from it amazing features discovering new ones daily its sleek design its versatility its userfriendliness and yes truth be told its affordability The only issue I have with it and this is specific to me and not the watch is my sensitivity to the material on its underside Alloyed metals and the like often make me its and give me a rash I affixed a piece of thin athletic tape to my wrist and problem solved Reading are the same as without All I can say is well done Apple I will test its durability and report back in 6 months This was watch was purchased to replace a standard watch that failed but it has proven that it is worth its weight in gold to me now Favorite feature is I have a loaded calendar with meeting and appointments and this watch will notify me discreetly while I am currently attending a meeting with out being rude in front of whom I am meeting by a phone flash or having to flip my phone over to read the display I can put my phone away and truly give my undivided attention to whomever is needing it at the time as well as staying on time for the upcoming meetings still on the calendar A must for someone with a busy professional lifestyle First off this watch saved my life I have never been diagnosed with Afib This past Friday night my watch told me I was in Afib and I went to the ER My heart rate was 147 bears a minute Had I not had this watch I would have just thought I was having an anxiety attack The battery life on this thing last longer then I would have imagined You can do so many things with it It\\x92s comfortable to wear and just absolutely amazing for the price I feel everyone should own one My fitbit after 5 yrs decided it didnt want to keep a charge so on prime day decided to get the apple watch I was skeptical but after a month of every day wear growing to like it more Wish I could find a better sleep app to match more like the fitbit had but Ive played around with a few of the add on apps and found one I like ok Lots of bells and whistles that Im not used to but Im getting there Im not one of those high end geeks who have a lot of apps it monitors just the practical ones I especially like if I am away from my phone I can answer a call from the watch Nifty One of my better choices for the amazon prime days I just upgraded from my Apple Watch 3 Can you believe I\\x92ve waited so long Hey it still works perfectly There are no problems with my old one I wanted the new one for the bigger face 41mm for my small wrist It\\x92s a wonderful instrument to have on your wrist I don\\x92t have to tell all the metrics it tracks I particularly keep the heart rate workout weather and calendar for my complications I keep a watchful eye on my heart rate Getting older these features give you a quick look at how your heart is doing And it\\x92s doing fine But it\\x92s good to know that it will contact my emergency contacts if any it can detect that is off occurs Overall I love it have always loved it It\\x92s only off my wrist when it\\x92s charging or I\\x92m in the shower Only point I\\x92d take off is that the battery doesn\\x92t last any longer than my old one It just charges faster But it never did take long charging Hopefully one day they can improve the battery life I purchased an Apple Watch seven even though I rarely like to wear watches and I already had an Apple Watch three The reason I did this was to try to make sure that I didn\\x92t have any sleep apnea issues as I\\x92ve been accused of snoring and wanted to make sure that that didn\\x92t indicate any potential problems So far the watch seems to indicate that I\\x92m OK I\\x92m not sure that all of these observations are full proof because they\\x92re done randomly throughout my sleep cycle so it may take a couple of months before anything bad shows up I have found the watch is really handy when I\\x92m cycling and I\\x92ve grown to like it very much Great purchase I love the Apple Watch i can comment on sleep tracking since I don\\x92t wear it at night \\nIt charges pretty quick and yes the battery last about a day but considering all that it can do and how often I used is to be expected\\nI love how the GPS vibrates and shows the directions as well as distance for next turn So it make it easy to not get distracted\\nI can also ask Siri to send text messages and make calls as long as the cellphone is nearby I hadn\\x92t test the distance\\nThe other thing is that can also be use as a light app that helps you with breathing techniques\\nThe oximeter and heart rate monitors work good\\n\\nI was really impress with all the functions that can do Also can work as a remote to take photos from your phone My son loves the Apple Watch we got him as a birthday gift He has not taken it off He loves all the clock face options He tracks his exercise times He maps his walksruns He often tracks the heart rate He will show me a new clock face every other day and is so happy to have all the choices Sadly we ordered on Amazon Day hoping for a quick delivery in time for his birthday But the watch was over a month delayed And it kept getting delayed further and further We love Apple products and now was have all five in our family Very highly recommeded Llevo un par de semanas utilizándolo y me ah gustado mucho es un buen upgrade para mi ya que nunca había comprado uno si tienes uno de generación 6 o 5 yo creo que aun puedes esperar hasta que salga uno con mejores actualizaciones como el 8 o futuros Apple Watch\\nLO QUE NO ME GUSTO No viene con el adaptador para cargar la batería solo viene con el cable a mi me toco conectarlo a mi computadora para ahorrarme dinero It has a lot of information on it so yeah the battery isn\\x92t gonna last a long time But fine with me I am getting so much information during the day exercise steps heart calls messages  And I can keep my phone in my pocket  I like the awards it makes you keep going hard to see since I bought a cover for it but I wanted to match my phone\\nLove the different watch faces Pretty cool watch tons of features  battery last a longgg time which is Great Little pricey  cellular service is limited  not available for all cell phone Providers like consumer cellular so check your cell phone provider before purchasing to make sure they offer service for the Apple Watch I Have to switch providers now but I should have checked before purchase Other than that it\\x92s a awesome watch I have been an Apple user for many years but always thought buying the Watch was costly I\\x92d had Fitbit Charge 4 and then Charge 5 until they started failing So I started looking at the Apple Watch on Amazon with Prime Days coming up I went into Costco to look at one in person since the Apple Store is in the mall and not easy for me to walk to Anyways I ordered the blue GPS version knowing I\\x92d have to get the charging block and added the 2 year AppleCare pkg There was an offer to get 200 off if I applied for the Prime card It was delivered the day after I placed the order the brick 2 days later I also ordered the hard screen protector  set of 2 I was able to set it up fairly easily I have had it now for 3 days and have tried several of the features So far the one con is trying to respond to a text on the Watch The keyboard is predictive and if you try to X out what you type it\\x92s right under the Send So my texts have been incomplete with typos Fat finger syndrome I changed the size of the text to help me see what I entered which helped a bit I\\x92m left handed so the Watch is on my left wrist Typing with the right hand is not the easiest for me so will be working on improving my right handed typing or using the dictation more often So far am glad to have bit the bullet I love the blue the size of the face the ability to change faces listen to music so many features Everyone thinks they know what is an Apple Watch I had no idea how much having this piece of technology on my wrist would be so helpful in my everyday life\\nI find the notifications useful not annoying because I see them instantly and don\\x92t end up retrieving a phone full of stuff I have to deal with all at once\\nMislaying my phone is a bad habit so I use that app a lot I wish I had gone for the bigger screen but was reluctant because of my small wrist Replying to texts would be easier\\nAnswering calls is fun Tracking sleep and the health details are why I bought this model\\nGetting free online advice about making the most out of the watch has proven very useful though I have not cracked taking a photo yet\\n\\nI am disappointed with the battery life sometimes it does not last the day and also with the screen which scratches very easily I got a plastic film protector very soon after buying when I realised that I already had scratch damage It has not affected the performance or look of the watch in any way Love my purchase I think this New Series 7 Apple Watch is great It is easy to use and the Always On Face is a big improvement over the older versions The Apps work great and I really like the Heart Beat Measurement and the O2 Level Measurements It also does a ECG that can be looked at on the iPhone in greater detail The Watch Faces are Super and I like the Infograph Version that I can put 4 functions around the edge of the clock face and 4 App Shortcuts in the center I am using a Deimiko Watch Band that does a great job protecting the Watch Face I still havent figured out all the things this watch can do But it was easy to set up and pair with my iPhone There are no instructions included so you go online to search them out Needed to charge battery almost every night great for finding my iPhone when misplaced\\nI tried to live with the size of the screen but ended up returning so I can order the larger size as my eyes were having difficulty reading many of the appsTHANK YOU Amazon for the easy returnalthough I havent received the credit yet but its only been 2 days I was really concerned about choosing the 45mm GPS model Blue was really leaning toward Red as I have never owned an Apple watch In fact I have not worn any type of watch for decades I must say for me I am extremely glad I went with the Apple 45mm I have only had it a few days One of the things that impresses me the most is it is not nearly as heavy as I had read The Always On feature makes it so easy to quickly see the time and the curved design allows one to read the time at all angles For the Face I choose Photos in which you can choose up to 24 photos The clarity of these is beyond expectation Colors are true to reality not dimmed not fuzzy not distorted Absolutely a treasure As I have been a medical transcriptionist for 25years and counting having the watch encourage me to Stand is a plus Also having the ability to run an EKG and check blood oxygen level are additional pluses Would I get another Apple Watch By all means yes Will I get different bands Yes The choices are almost endless  That being said love the watch Plenty of features from multiple watch face to health tracking I love that when I am using maps on Applecar play the watch pulses when I have to make a turn Unfortunately I am retired so I now longer wear my watch all the time I really like the feature that tells me to stand up once an hour D I was upgrading from a series 4 My series 4 was getting maybe 18 hours on a full charge when it was brand new but had deteriorated to needing to be charged 34 times per day This new one has had amazing battery life for me I have had it for about a month and right now it has been 25 hours since my last full charge and it is at 27 battery It has been averaging 2728 hours from fully charged to 10 My series 4 was 40mm and this one is 41mm I didn\\x92t expect 1mm to make such a big difference but it really does as you can see in the picture I attached When I first bought the watch it died 9 hours after charging I was so upset and saw a lot of people have battery problems with the series 7 I switched the screen to a simpler background and turned off the background refresh for most apps and it was still dying\\n\\nAfter a few days it got better and now I can use whatever screen background I want and I don\\x92t have to charge it every day So give it time to adjust I\\x92m super happy with my watch and it\\x92s a huge upgrade from my Series 1 I had a series 3 and a series 4 Apple watch I wore the series 3 while I sleep and the series 4 during the day and would charge the one I wasnt currently using I gave my sister the series 3 after I received the Series 7 I do the same thing with the series 4 and 7 as I did with the series 3 and 4 All you need to do is to go to Apples site to see all the functions the series 7 does The main differences I notice from the series 4 to the 7 are\\nLonger battery life\\nFaster charging\\nLarger better screen\\nThe Blood Oxygen function\\nIt appears to be faster at running apps\\n\\nThe main reason I was in the market for a new Apple watch was because the series 3 will not be compatible with the next Apple watchOS 9 coming out later this year I\\x92m so happy I bought this watch I have envied other people who had Apple watches It\\x92s comfortable to wear though I did replace the strap to one that had a regular fastener Too bad they put such a difficult watchband on an expensive watch But it works great and I was specially happy to buy it with interest free payments to Amazon for 12 months I hesitated to get this because of the cost and I wasnt sure how much I would use it But after having a fall on a trail I wanted the fall detection feature as a safety measure And this watch turned out to be so much more than that It even has a timer for hand washing and Im still learning about all of its amazing health and exercise tracking features I can make and answer phone calls and messages without having to get my iPhone out of my day pack or pocket And as far as how much I would use my watch I wear it everyday from the time that I get up until bedtime Highly recommend I don\\x92t really use my Apple Watch when I have access to my phone The sleep tracking is okay it\\x92ll be better once the new watch OS update comes out because then it\\x92ll track your REM light sleep deep sleep etc Right now it\\x92s just the amount of hours you slept Which isn\\x92t as exciting I find this SUPER useful when walking my dog My dog likes to pull and it\\x92s nice to look at wrist if I get a text and not have to use my other hand lol to pull out my phone Voice dictation is handy when it works 85 of the time If you like to go out and not worry about your phone getting stolen in passing this is great I can change the volume of the music and skip to the next song with this watch I can look at my Google maps with this watch if I want to walk somewhere but not have my phone out It has a lot of capabilities and it\\x92s sleek One other thing I love using it for besides all the health stuff I can look at my reminders easily I like this a lot since I use that to have my grocery list If I want to quickly add something to the list without taking my phone out I can or I can easily walk around the grocery store and check things off on my wrist rather than having a paper list of looking at my phone What did I do before I owned this watch Pick up my phone like one of the poors Now I know everything at every second of the day All the news all of my health all of my habits all of the texts and calls I\\x92m ignoring Everything I can start my car with my watch I can open and close my garage with my watch I have a timer on my wrist I am truly living high on the hog The one thing I can\\x92t do Get that dang walkin talkie to work  I love my watch I\\x92m not really computer savvy and it was easy to connect with my phone it connects to Siri and she is easy to use  u can also talk to people on ur watch If u r walking or exercising at all u can keep track of it with ur watch That is all I really have to say  Purchased during Prime Days No regrets Easy setup and very comfortable I use the Workout app for my daily walks At the same time I use the Podcast app which provides control of all the necessary podcast functions while I walk The Heart Rate app is fantastic I also love the activity app that tracks my step count and other health attributes I find the Messages app useful as well allowing me to leave the phone in my pocket The querty keyboard works amazingly well but I also like dictating messages I am preferring the Infograph Modular watch face as it is easiest for me to read and provides easy access to my preferred complications battery life activities workout and podcasts I wasn\\x92t going to get an Apple Watch After doing much research into which model would be best for me I chose the series 7 on black with a black band I love it It has so many useful apps that are pertinent to my lifestyle And it\\x92s fun I\\x92m so glad I decided to purchase Love this series watch from Apple If you are conservative with the notifications you allow to push to your watch\\x85 then the battery life is outstandingtruly I can go two full days plus before needing to charge my watch And with the charging cord included you can charge the watch in approximately 45 minutes This was an awesome purchase I researched periodically for a year waiting for the right device I bought an Oura ring last year but was disappointed with the way results are displayed I got dizzy and lost my balance then tripped and fell in my kitchen both the same week Then apple watches went on sale during prime days This watch has Fall Detection yes please On top of that there are so many watch faces to choose from You can switch the watch faces simply by swiping sideways on your watch So fun Its almost like having your phone and apps on your wrist This watch is so incredibly versatile and impressive it has features to please just about anyone Battery life is better\\x85 but the screen is what really got me Brighter and easier to read I had a version 3 for years  no problems but wanted to upgrade \\x85 very happy I don\\x92t wear for sleep often but the data is interesting Still not where fitbits where for battery but offer so much more I was convinced that I didn\\x92t this device but my relatives talked me into it I use it more than I ever thought I would The voice texting is more accurate than my iPhone I am an elderly man and use all the health features daily I could go and on but I love it I had the first series of apple watch It lasted me about 7 years I was hoping it would last even longer LOL but the face lifted off I watched a YouTube vide on how to purchase a special glue and glue it back down That worked for about 7 months and again the face separated from the watch apparently this is an issue as many of my friends experienced the same thing and I hope Apple has fixed that problem Prime day I finally ordered this watch and its great I wish they still had the 38mm available for the new apple watches but the 41mm wasnt too much bigger though I could not find the 7 series in a 40mm This watch has amazing new features Glad I upgraded and I hope this watch last at least 7 years Initially I couldnt justify spending the money on one of these when the series 1 and series 2 didnt really do it for me I ended up purchasing it on sale because why not I was extremely impressed Not only is the screen super crisp but the build quality is a lot better and feels better I also LOVE the sleep tracking and the fitness app encourages me to get some exercise and close my rings I never thought a watch would get me outside and moving I also can leave my phone at home during walks and listen to the music I downloaded to the watch I went from not even wanting one to being in the mind set where Id buy a new one tomorrow if this one broke I also turned off the always on display and get over 2 days without a charge Love it I surprised my husband with an apple watch when I saw it on sale and picked the green as it looks less casualworkout and more daywear It comes with two sizes for the bands I will say the large band runs very large Hes been loving it and learning the functions of the watch easily I wish I bought a screen protector too but so far no issues This size head is definitely better than the smaller one for use and vision it just looks nicer too Anniversary present for my husband He hasn\\x92t worn a watch in years and didn\\x92t think he would bother to wear this either\\nOur son showed him all of the amazing things the watch can do for you He LOVES it and wishes I would have bought him one sooner This is my second Apple Watch I love it It tracks my steps heart rate steadiness walking asymmetry and many other things The battery life isn\\x92t quite as good as i wish but ok And I love my Minnie Mouse face and her cute little voice Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it It barely ever has to charge and when it does it charges super fast Comes with a lot of fun features that the 5 didn\\x92t He loves how it can track his health even when he\\x92s sleeping I love this watch it stays charged from 7am to 12pm on a normal busy day tracks all my steps and fitness and also have helpful apps like calculator just in case you gotta do quick math By far the best investment on my person on 2022 I bought this on Prime Day so I got it for a good price So glad I purchased this watch Love how it mirrors my phone It can do a multitude of things from track your sleep to countdown washing your hands etc etc there\\x92s so much you can do with this watch My new fav I resisted buying an Apple Watch for a long time but finally caved when I was choosing between renewing a subscription that accompanies my stationary bike or doing something different I chose the different and dont regret it for a second Tracking my daily activity is much more reliable Im not completely tethered to my phone to capture all my steps The gamified rings offers a nice sense of accomplishment as well particularly important for those who have a burning need to check something off the list every day I got the green one during the prime day sale because it was the best price Swapped the band for a black one and the green watch is now very subtle It lasts two days on a charge if I\\x92m not recording long work outs and the interface is noticeably snappier compared to the three Siri works much better for me and the screen has a lot more real estate without making the watch noticeably larger Love the watch but every time I turn around it needs to be charged I don\\x92t remember my previous Apple Watch having to be charged before each day comes to an end\\x85 that\\x92s my only complaint \\x85 otherwise it does everything I want and more I expected to find the Apple Watch Series 7 in blue my favorite color to be useful but I did not realize how much the watch can do Am still discovering all the ways the watch can help me be organized in touch  healthy Love this Apple Watch for working out and keeping myself accountable I don\\x92t mind that there\\x92s no GPS option on it either it\\x92s just fine I\\x92ve never used the sleep tracking option but I like the other health monitors it includes Am really impressed with the clarity of the calls I can heated the caller and vice versa I didn\\x92t know if and Apple Watch was really nessacery but now I don\\x92t like to be with out it Love love love it I love my Apple Watch 7 This is my first time to buy a smartwatch and I\\x92m glad I bought the latest one Worth all the money I guess it depends on really what you need I\\x92m in it for the fitness tracking plus the customizations I can do with it are just superb\\n\\nTook 1520 mins to pair it up with my iPhone My package was packed well and shipped right away A hasslefree transaction I had the watch 1 so the watch 7 was a big upgrade for me I like that I can swim or take showers with it on skiing with the other features I\\x92m a big some fan Good bargainglad I got one  wish it had longer battery life but it makes it up in other ways great gift for someone or for yourself never unhappy with any of my other products by them I really like my new watch I love the blue color the size and the connection to my phone There is a lot of things that I haven\\x92t checked into but hopefully I will find time to do it The Apple Watch 7 series is another incremental step forward in the Apple Watch family of devices The battery life is improved over the series 6 devices and the new blood oxygen monitoring is a nice feature\\n\\nSleep tracking is OK but not yet on par with the fitbit sleep tracking functionality Hopefully apple will catch up eventually with this functionality While the battery life is improved it is still also one of the weak points of the device You will be charging your watch every 48 hours at a minimum Compared to a fitbit which lasts almost a week this is a notable weakness\\n\\nAll that being said if you are invested in the apple iPhone and iOS ecosystem there is no better smartwatch on the market I upgraded from a Series 3 to the Series 7 45mm The size of the screen is incredible Not too big for my small wrist in my opinion Being able to type a text on a full keyboard is a game changer The \\x93always on\\x94 screen is cool but does drain the battery I charge my watch every night and after 14 hours the battery has about 30 remaining Not a big deal to me but if you want the battery to last multiple days perhaps turn off this setting The rapid charge is truly rapid  charges fully in 12 hours Would highly recommend The watch works great  I used the batteries lasted longer  I feel like I\\x92m charging it everyday  I\\x92m still getting used to how to use it  But I love it I went from a Fitbit to an Apple Watch  I like that the Fitbit tracked steps  vs calories Talking in the phone and exiting off the phone watch is great I use my watch for two things keeping track of my activity during the day and notifications\\nWith an easily customizable watch face I can keep track of multiple things during the day without having to touch my watch\\nThe ping is loud enough if you want it to be the font size is customizable\\nOverall a great product\\nHave not yet tested in water This is my first Apple Watch I love it I\\x92m happy with the battery life and think it charges pretty quickly It\\x92s fast and works well in partnership with my phone I moved from a series 5 to this series 7 and it seems much better to me The bigger screen helps and it\\x92s just faster and has more goodies I recommend the Apple Watch series 7 I was impressed with the battery life as it last about 2 days and charges fairly quick I was worried about the face being too big on my small wrist but it feelslooks good Hi I have had an Apple Watch for many years This series 7 however provides vital information concerning my health in regards to my vitals This watch is more than I could even imagine I initially was going to get an SE until this went on sale for Prime Day so I went with this one due to the massive savings Aside from being a tiny bit bigger that number one thing that makes this watch better for me is the alwayson screen It does dim a bit but it is always on and it brightens up when you raise it There are tons of other features but this is the number one thing for me that makes this watch better Sadly Apple has since raised their prices on hardware so you may have to wait until Black Friday now to get another deal I just received the watch today and I love it It was very easy to sync with the iPhone 11 There are a lot of options you have to consider but that\\x92s a good thing I love everything about it except guess what There was no charging box It just came with its USB c cable but no box Fortunately I had a powerbank that will work until my wall charger arrives next week Yes I had to order that separately Still I got a great deal on prime day so I\\x92m not complaining just surprised let\\x92s say I did my first workout on it and that was awesome too Also made a phone call with it Now that\\x92s convenient Looks very classy too Happy camper My older version iwatch died and one of my complaints was the short battery life This iwatch last a minimum of 24 hours I love being able to answer calls from my watch I got this Apple watch for about 20 less than at the Apple store Also was able to buy Apple Care here too A no brainer Everything is great My battery lasts almost two days with moderate use It would be better if Apple would figure out how to make a better battery but Im not complaining There arent many watchband options for the original purchase here but save the hassle and buy a 15 knockoff watchband instead This Apple Watch Series 7 GPS 45mm has so much to offer than the first one I had I like the fact I can keep track of my health and wellbeing on one device This is my 3rd Apple Watch and every time they get better and better The battery life is great the new health trackers are really cool overall I love the new size I had brought the fist one that came out years ago it finally broke so had to get another got the 7 live it faces is bigger that what I had Well the watch is great but the pricing not so great I paid 359 for it and only 2 weeks later the price is 329 Not happy at all Still getting used to having a watch like this The only thing I don\\x92t care for is the color of the band Would have preferred white or pale pink\\nI like that I was able to make the face larger print since my vision is not so great anymore\\n\\nGoing to sign up for the free 3month fitness trial next I upgraded my Apple Watch series 2 to this one and it is world of difference Battery life is great though I am sure I had battery degradation on my series 2 Also I got it on prime day so the fact that it was 120 off when compared to the apple store helps lol I am a huge fan of apple but the capability and snappiness of the iOS is great The new O2 levels are super cool It is a genuine product that was my only concern If you are an Apple Watch person looking to upgrade this is a great deal It does more than I expected It EKG app is fenomenon Battery life does not last very long but watch charges fast with the charging cord and magnet provided by apple I upgraded from the series one and I wore it everyday and this one had been a gam changer I love it the battery it SO much better too Its amazing what can be fit into a watch these days and Apple lives up to the hype Theres a bit of a learning curve if youve never had an Apple watch before  for example mine was waking me up at 3 am telling me it was time to stand and walk for one minute The battery was depleting very quickly due to all the apps and features I had to decide which ones were important or useful for me and turn off the rest Even so Im a little disappointed in the battery life  charge goes down by 40 in 24 hours and I do sleep with it so I have to plug it in to charge every morning to be safe\\n\\nAs others have noted the watch comes with a charging cord but NOT the block to plug it into I can understand not providing a regular USB block  I have multiple ways to charge USB in fact many public facilities provide such access USBC is NOT widespread yet so its an added expense to purchase one Even though I was forewarned I was not pleased about that\\n\\nStill I like the health and exercise features I like the preview of incoming calls and text messages and I like being able to customize the home screen for quick information I\\x92d resisted buying one for a long time but now can\\x92t imagine not having it It\\x92s very convenient and more discreet in meetings than pulling out my phone If you\\x92ve had an Apple Watch in the past it\\x92s the same platform with a few new features like fall detection heart rate notifications emergency SOS I bought mine because it was time for an upgrade and the price was right If you have an Apple Watch I would recommend getting the watch So far so good Still learning new features and apps Has been great after downloading an app to check my blood sugar it will tell me if I am high or low with a warning Actually made my first call thru my watch\\nIm sure I will be learning more each day I feel safer now that I have a Watch that can recognize a hard fall with ptions to call one of two predesignated persons or 911 for help I like the blood oxygen sensor Weight is perfect and the remote camera feature makes vlogging easy from the iPhone Size is sleek as well just wish there were more shape options as opposed to the basic \\x91rectangle\\x92 all apple watches are made as\\n\\nI left it on my wrist during a moment of intimacy however and what must have been the Siri feature audibly said \\x93okay\\x94 at the moment of climax Now I don\\x92t personally mind the evaluation as with the fitness app I have personal goals standards to meet But I feel that just an \\x93okay\\x94 during that particular session was a bit overly critical given the duration and positions taken to achieve this point Hopefully Apple can improve upon these \\x91evaluations\\x92 or just stick with calorie countingexercise duration in these situations\\n\\nAnyways it\\x92s been a solid device overall What can I say about an Apple Watch It\\x92s the best So many functions like a piece of jewelry because we can change the cover the bands etc I love it I already had to buy a case to put all my accessories in Only negative is you have to buy the charging plug separately  For the price this should be included The screen is amazing  large and clear edge to edge It integrates really well with my iPhone I like the different health apps The sleep tracker isn\\x92t as good as Fitbit The battery like is just ok  I definitely need to charge daily The included band works great and stays secure Overall I think it is a great watch with lots of apps and lots of possibilities I barely use 10 of the available functionality Too soon to tell I just received it today I have been wearing an Apple 4 for last couple years so I am excited to this 7 Love my apple watch and price was very competitive Now i wear it for running and tracking my sleep Even works w my work security app Bought this for my son The had one before  series 3 and after two years the screen went black The cost to repair was just about as much as a new one so it was a great birthday gift for him He loves it just make sure you purchase the AppleCare I got this primarily as a heart rate monitor I was scared off of dedicated cheaper devices based on various reviews This is my first smart watch and I\\x92ve quickly become a fan Many apps have versions for the Apple Phone note some do NOT have apps for the phone Additional health tracking is cool breathsminute while I sleep Cool feature to have phone \\x93buzz\\x94 you for alarms are a great way for me to wake up to my morning alarm while allowing my partner to sleep in Battery life isn\\x92t ideal but from all I\\x92ve heard Apple has taken great strides towards improving this with the Series 7 Overall a solid purchase I\\x92m happy I love this watch but when it came time to charge it I was disappointed that Apple did not include the adapter required to attach to the charging cable which was included The adapter used with my IPad did not fit so I had to buy an adapter C\\x92mon Apple you need to do better than this Why make the customer have to buy an adapter It should be included with the watch This is my first Apple watch I just turned 70 and I really love it I suggest you watch YouTube videos prior to opening the box There are many helpful hints to get you started and use the many features of the watch I like changing the watch face to go with whatever I am wearing for the day I find the heart rate ECG Activity log and fall risk to be helpful and comforting Its a bit pricey but if it helps prevent one accident or gives you peace of mind it is definitely worth it I do like the watch and do believe it gives fair value but several of the features I was looking forward to are a little lacking\\nI really wanted it to monitor my activity and work outs but find that it\\x92s just not very accurate at measuring the things I want to keep tracked of My third Apple Watch Being older this gives me more apps to monitor my health Previous model Series 3 alerted me I was having AFibs I was able to show my doctor who immediately referred me to a cardiologist who now how has me on medication to help prevent a stroke from the AFibs Now I can do an ECKEKG using my watch and monitor my blood oxygen level Definitely worth upgrade from the Series 3 I love this watch I decided to treat myself and I am very glad I did Just read about it and van be a life saver too takes your heart rateecg exercises  has a walkie talkietells you to stand when youve been sitting to long etc Not sure why I waited so long to get one but so happy I got this one Easy to use easy to read Great watch and the band actually fits on a large wrist I don\\x92t regret this purchase Battery isn\\x92t great but isn\\x92t on my old one or my wife\\x92s Samsung so I\\x92m thinking that\\x92s the norm Tracks heart rate well and suggest tracking workouts if I forget I bought Apple Watch for 40000  friend bought it the next day for 200 Plus it didn\\x92t come with the electrical cord to plug it into the circle charger Bummer Should have included the cord for 400 I like my watch otherwise Bought it for ECG At least once a day someone asks is that the new apple watch I wear it every day but so many features I need to figure it all out and thats my fault Comfortable need to charge daily All good and got a decent price Everything you love about the Apple Watch just larger screen now I upgraded from my 3 to this model and so glad I did This is a must have for Apple users\\x85 and if you\\x92re an Android user well it\\x92s time to make the switch I love the way the watch looks Love the stainless steel band very classy However I don\\x92t like that it doesn\\x92t stay charged for mor than 16 hrs Always have to charge it It doesn\\x92t allow my phone to let me know when calls or texts come in and I can\\x92t tell on the watch as it only does a very short vibration I do love the 45mm face easy to see I just wish it would stay charged for longer  The size is very good fro people that dont want to carry in the wrist a huge watch that looks like an tablet I bought this because my employer requires a fitness tracker in order to get a discount for health insurance I have used a Fitbit device for more than 10 years I got the 45 mm Apple Watch because I need reading glasses for small print The fitness step tracker records about 5 less steps than the Fitbit does If you need reading glasses there is not a whole lot that you can do with the watch face\\x96 \\x96 The font is too small to be usable It\\x92s easy to click into the apps which are readable with a larger font The integration with the Apple health app on the cloud is excellent You can answer calls to your iPhone on your watch which is very helpful if you can\\x92t remember where you put your phone The audio quality is excellent It\\x92s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can\\x92t remember where are you left it The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen This happens when you place to watch on your wrist in the morning or remove it during the day The battery life is just OK It only charges from an Apple proprietary charger \\x96 \\x96 it charges quickly but the battery only lasts a day or two \\x96 \\x96 much shorter than the Fitbit life The battery charging cords are not cheap There is one included in the box You are probably going to need to purchase a second one The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter which is also an expense I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse Since it doesn\\x92t have a charging plugin it\\x92s pretty waterproof Like any Apple product it works well it\\x92s very expensive and you are semi glad you bought it The battery lasts about 1 and 12 days I usually charge it while sleeping so I don\\x92t use the sleep tracking love how it lets me know if I have a text or phone call it also helps keep track of my exercise This is my first Apple watch and I\\x92m very impressed It does everything I need it to do The band is comfortable and for a watch this size it\\x92s lightweight I did order a protective case and glad I did because we spend a lot of time outdoors and I don\\x92t want to worry about smacking it on a tree I like not having to bring my phone everywhere are go it\\x92s not as big of a distraction The sleep tracking works really well helps me keep but tract of my sleeping habits I really like the fitness app helps me keep my fitness in check a lot better I was sitting when my watch said I had a high heart rate  I did indeed got worse  long story short ended up in hospital  Home doing well now Thank God  thanks I watch   Love it all It does it all Health sleep tracking exercise or not texts too much to mention here Awesome watch I love my new Apple Watch My old one was annoying when it went black all the time\\nMy new watch has some new features but my favorite is I can ALWAYS see what time it is with a glance This watch is awesome I bought this for my husband I already had one This sync\\x92s very easy with our iPhones We have had fitbits in the past but this is by far the best watch I highly recommend this product I purchased Series 7 watches for my husband sisterinlaw and myself We all love them We charge them while we\\x92re getting dressed every day and wear them constantly They were easy to sync with our phones and are fun to use It\\x92s been a little bit of a learning curve but I like the screen size and the comfort of the band Band color is also very neutral which is what I wanted I\\x92m figuring out how to time the charging I purchased this to qualify for 200 a year back on my insurance premiums and it works with the program I have to connect it with Virgin Fitness and Strata and it works pretty well with both apps and Ive been pretty happy with it I was hoping it might have more functionality than email and text notifications but I like being able to take calls on the watch  the real Inspector Gadget breakthrough was discovering I could converse through the watch I have to charge it daily so get a cheap fast charger if such a thing exists Im finding most watch chargers are not designed for the 7 series fast capabilities  booo The EKC feature is cool but the workout functions are kinda hit or miss Its probably user error There are also a lot of useless apps that Ill probably never use Very impressive watch Easy to use and learn Vast array of faces that can be adjusted for personal uses It works great but be advised that this version does NOT have the super durable screen that I thought it would I picked this up without even considering a screen protector because I was under the impression that it had the unscratchable sapphire glass or whatever but apparently thats only on the nonaluminum body models My dog pushed my arm into the wall while playing and the screen was scratched on the 4th day of wearing it I waited a long time to buy this but I am glad I finally did Love the features and its a little big on my wrist but pretty easy to read Lots of great apps and perfect for me Great choice New series 7 is water resistant to the max Screen is durable against walls and drops Battery life is long lasting I adore this watch great quality good battery easy to use Best purchase ever and color is so cute Very comfortable to sleep in while tracking your sleep habits I wear my Apple Watch 7 Series always and the battery life is incredible When you do charge your watch it is charged at lightning speed First got it and was pretty impressed Never had a smart watch before and I liked the sleep tracking hear beat monitoring notifications from the phone calling from watch etc\\n\\nbut battery life was horrendous so much so it affected my iPhone too when connected that it would only last 3 hours for the day when it usually lasted the whole day When I updated the watch both battery life\\x92s significantly improved but was upsetting I wasn\\x92t made aware of this beforehand as I had missed some important information from having my phone die so much sooner than anticipated\\n\\nOnly have owned the watch for a week now so will update again\\nEdit battery life is completely normal and watch battery lasts a little over a day and night use One of the main reasons I got the Apple Watch over others is the heart monitor tracking It works great and my cardiologist asked me to upload the heart rate data before my next appointment I didnt know it could do that Super feature Also I use the feature that always shows what is next on my calendar I really like this watch Love this watch  does everything as expected Moved on from a temperamental Fitbit Versa  love how efficient everything is and of course how it connects to my iPhone Great investment in my health I\\x92m old I need easy to navigate I like it but my fit bit did better and was easier The battery in my 3 watch would not stay charged for the day This watch stays charged for the day plus I got this as a gift for myself and I love it glad I bought it Love my new Apple Watch Worst part\\x85 it took a month for it to be delivered Really like my Apple Watch Has so many features and I am slowly learning about them Nice watch to have if you want the features and compatibility with your iPhone Easy to setup and use Beautiful functional watch I love this watch I can read my text messages I can answer phone calls and can hear and talk through the watch there are great apps Well worth the money Love all the features The fall detection It\\x92s a big step up from my series 3 Me agradó mucho porque es lo que esperaba el color el peso y la funcionalidad me son bastante útiles I love the sleep tracking and alarm feature I\\x92m able to have a better start to my day since purchasing this watch of pure awesomeness I never owned an Apple Watch to compare the battery life but so far so good EXACTLY what she was looking for and performs as expected Zero complaints So much better than a series 2 Apple Watch Battery life is remarkable Price during Amazo Prime Days was outstanding I\\x92m so glad I invested in the new iwatch 7 with ECG monitoring It\\x92s amazing My heart rate is usually on the low side so I use it to track my heart rate and calories It works amazingly So far I love my Apple Watch Still learning all the possibilities After unboxing the Apple Watch and setting it up I was amazed at how much bigger this version is than my previous 41MM series 5 The screen is literally huge compared to previous Apple watches that I have owned The text is very easy to see and set up was incredibly simple The dark navy color of the watch case and band complement each other perfectly They are a darker shade of blue almost a deep navy Wearing the 45 MM sport band instead of the sport solo loop is very comfortable and stays on my wrist through Moderat arm movements I would highly recommend getting this size of Apple Watch even if you have small to medium sized wrist My wrist is on the smallish side and the watch fits perfectly without any discomfort Overall an excellent watch for sleep tracking and other fitness activities The Apple Series 7 watch is excellent and does everything it is supposed to do The case is strong and the glass although not scratchproof resists scratches quite well\\n\\nWith Apple products there are many aftermarket products like watch bands and case and screen protectors The ubiquity of Apple makes it easy to find whatever additions you want to make the watch truly your own\\n\\nThe list of available apps is lengthy and the interface and interactivity with an iPhone gives maximum flexibility Have always doubted that it could be worth the money but you know what I really do like it and it just may be I like my old Fitbit but this is really nice with many great features Ordered for my sons 13th Birthday and he totally loved it I have become a watch wearer again Love that I can check my schedules texts and emails But to be honest I use it mostly to find my iPhone It ends up in the darnedest places As expected it doesnt track sleep on a moving tour bus But love it anyway Bought as a gift and person who it was gifted to loves loves it I love my watch it has so many different things that it can do track steps lets me know if I have a message and also will ring and I can answer my phone with it I bought it so that I could better track workouts along with other health data Strong pulse sensors\\x85never losses the signal Wish it tracked deep REM and light sleep like other fitness trackers but it doesn\\x92t Liked lookscomfort and health monitor apps Activity app good but battery life not best Using long distance hiking activity battery did not last full day even with most options closed Syncs and works great with an iPhone and the price was nice We had some other nonApple smart watches that just never worked quite right so we finally caved and bought an Apple Watch What else can i say The watch is awesome Most app are compatible with watch Battery life is decent being that it is a watch Two days of battery in my case use messaging on it Watch is amazing but bought it to monitor my swing in golf but there was not golf app installed The one inside a calories counter and the same as you will walk or run This was an early surprise gift for my daughter She loves it What I like about this product is that it\\x92s not only paired up with my iPhone  but it\\x92s like the watch and iPhone have became almost one and the same connected together Whenever I have any messages coming or if my phone is charging and I\\x92m busy it always sends me an alert and notification or if I\\x92m playing my music it allows me to pause and rewind back as well And as for the battery life it seems perfectly fair and easy to use Definitely would recollection it  Does this watch track sleep I thought it did but I\\x92m used to how my Fitbit Versa 2 tracked my sleep and I can not figure out how this Apple Watch could do something like that If you know please reply and let me know And I\\x92m not talking about adding an additional app where you have to pay for all the features andor a subscription Besides having to charge the watch just about every day and not being able to figure out how to track my sleep the watch it great I\\x92ve never had an Apple Watch before so this was mostly a great purchase It\\x92s a great purchase It helps you get your sleep on track exercise reminders and messages on the go There are workout goals that you can complete in which helps you earn medals This has helped me become more consistent in developing a healthier plan for myself It\\x92s a great watch It charges from dead to fully charged in one hour I put a case on it so it doesn\\x92t scratch I also like how there\\x92s a water eject button About battery life turn off the always on display this will allow the screen to automatically come on when you turn your wrist to look at the watch With the AOD off the watch will drain about 2 per hour with light use When I leave for work at 6am and return at 530pm my watch is at 80 This is not with heavy use about 25 hrs of the time it is controlling GPS on my phone and music playing via bluetooth\\n\\nAs for not including a brick for the USB charger if you own an iPhone you should have a brick anyway so not a big deal Plus these days if you got a brick for everything you would need multiple power strips for them Just buy a USB brick that has multiple outlets so you can charge your phone watch laptop tablet and all the other things that take USBC Really one of the best smart watch in the market Coming from LTE S4 this GPS S7 is brilliant and I don\\x92t even have to worry for coming phone calls or music With 32GB is enough to load all the music want and works very smoothly This fitness tracker has encouraged me to get farther into living an active healthy lifestyle The prime day price was unheard of I\\x92m happy I was able to score that good of a deal I love the watches and what they do I love my Apple Watch Great Prime Day price and quick shipping I have been thinking about the Apple Watch for quite a while had a colonoscopy a year ago and learned that my AFIB had returned Long story short I had a cardio version and was put on a beta blocker which worked well for about 6 days Then my heart would kick back into AFIB for a little while then the beta blocker would try to convert back to sinus rythym in doing so my heart would do what they call conversion pauses only mine would pause to the point of nearly passing out I happened to catch one of the worst pauses that lasted 87 seconds I was using my Apple Watch in the ECG mode to check AFIB at the time My heart was pausing multiple times Sent the recordings to my heart dr and he took me off the beta blocker for now I will go back on those after I get my pacemaker the end of the month If it had not been for the watch and the ability to do the ECGs I would have not known what was going on and would have thought it to be common under the circumstances So I think the watch may have saved my life by helping to figure out the pauses which kept getting worse Thanks to Apple Im still here to write about it Sure something else may have worked just as well but this is what worked for me It saved me having to wear a monitor for weeks at the very least Wife loves the watch but not the band I\\x92m glad I waited for Prime Day and got it cheaper than through other retailers Although with Prime Day you can\\x92t add Apple Care but I was able to add it through Apple after the fact I\\x92m still getting used to it but it\\x92s nice to not always need my phone I do question the battery life though as it doesn\\x92t seem to last the amount of hours they claim Have enjoyed the watch and it\\x92s capabilities but wish the battery had a longer lifetime between charges Had a Fitbit prior to this and it lasted 67 days between charges This watch is amazing Love the faces and all that it can do Health apps are great Nothing to dislike about this Apple Watch 7 Best Watch I\\x92ve ever owned Just the fact that you can change bands and tailored it to your style alone beats out the comparison I\\x92m really loving my Apple Watch  all the cool things it does Activity tracking is inspiring Mindfulness is helping me with Yoga seeing iPhone notifications is helpful\\nI do not like that I must charge it daily  you can\\x92t do it overnight if you want sleep tracking In any case soon I wouldn\\x92t be able to live without it I got this watch as a Bday present for my wife The primary reason was fitness tracking and mostly for the heart rate feature when shes on her bike The screen is big and easy for her to see at a glance The set up seemed to be easy even for her as she is not tech savvy Cant figure out the sleep tracker however Overall I think she likes it or she acts like she likes it\\nCons It AINT CHEAP Battery life is short She opened it to discover the power cord was missing which means that it had previously been opened That was a hassle trying to figure out what to do Talked to Amazon about it and they offered me 40 to go drive all over creation and find a way to charge it The wrist band provided is quite literally a joke Order a cheapo one piece when you order the watch The problem is that it very easily pops open and the watch falls to the ground just like that a dozen times a day and sometimes you dont realize it has come off So that makes it super easy to lose Really really stupid and poor design and they should be ashamed Thenwhat we ordered was the Apple Series 7 GPS Brand new not reconditioned What we got was the Apple Series 7 GPS and Cellular which is a much more expensive watch but we got it for the GPS only price So again that confirms that the packaging was opened up and things were removed and switched OR it means that we got a reconditioned watch THAT would really piss me off but I cant confirm it All it all it is decent she likes it and we are moving forward with life Patrick J Fruita Colorado The battery life is excellent as long as you limit the always on feature Durable and exceptionally advanced Well worth it Awesome technology features I didn\\x92t get the cellular version since it connects to my iPhone capabilities and mirrors the call and text on my iPhone as long as the iPhone is within range Love the size of the screen The only negative thing I can say it has is battery life Used to have a fit bit and battery lasted longer almost a week Other than that everything works great I did purchased a case for screen to protect it from being scratched It does come with two bands a medium and a large comes with charger but not charger box so you will need to buy a C charging box for it fits any generic brand box Got mine at Walmart for under 11 You get what you expect It\\x92s an apple device Quality Reliability Smoothness Only downside is the battery Obviously it\\x92s going to be less in the 41mm You\\x92ll have to charge it every night or morning if you plan on using it through your the day Looks sleek too Its far more beautiful in person than shown here I bought a 15 black chain and its beautiful perfect for me Ive always been fascinated by watches but never owned one I enjoyed so much Also my watch tells me accurately my Oxygen level Some folks have claimed its inaccurate but its correct the way I use it which I will explain here Please note Ive compared it to my oximeter which is absolutely accurate compared to one of the worlds largest hospitals oxygen reporting machines and its inline with both\\n\\nAt sleep my oxygen goes down so its accuracy is imperative to me I wear it on my left wrist slightly further away from my hands I use my hands a lot playing guitar doing dishes typing\\n\\nThe ECC is fascinating but Im blessed to not have need of it at this point\\n\\nI like the awards and motivational achievement things\\n\\nI love how it finds my phone my daughters phone and wifes phone\\n\\nThe display is fantastic Beautiful The faces are wonderful\\n\\nThe price dropped dramatically and I nearly sent it back I didnt because I love the watch The original band it came with really is awful\\n\\nI love the way it charges with a magnetic no plug charger It charges very fast I have to charge it once a day\\n\\nThe speaker and mic are okay They work although I feel funny talking into my watch Futuristic in a retro way\\n\\nThe band it comes with did not work for me at all It has two sizes but it appears flimsy and keeps falling off On the plus side it fell many times and I nearly returned it for that but it did not break so I did not Watch bands are plentiful and all are better than the OEM\\n\\nDoes not take blood pressure as far as I can tell Thats about all it doesnt do\\n\\nIm not yet certain about subscribing to the apple watch thing I have a 3 month trial period before I will decide So far I havent needed that aspect of it I suppose if I were to work out on my own it would be very good\\n\\nGreat watch  beautiful appears to be water proof Strong Great display So long as it lasts Im very happy Replace the OEM band immediately Its been my experience that my Apple products last a long time\\n\\nMy daughter and wife both want one Works great love sleep tracker I really like the watch Love this watch very functional Got it a nice price The watch is great I probably missed it in the listing but no power adapter came with the watch It requires a power adapter that receives usb C I was so excited to get my watch then Couldn\\x92t use it for 24 hours until I ordered and received the power adapter I have a power adapter now and love the watch Potential purchasers make sure you order a power adapter with your watch And now I love it Apple watch is perfect for keeping track of your fitness It has a good amount of modes and features that are specific to different workouts The UI had built in features like \\x93fitness rings\\x94 and \\x93Achievements\\x94 to keep you motivated towards completing your daily workouts\\n\\nIt has a builtin heart rate monitor It also keeps track of your calories burned which is the primary reason for my purchase\\n\\nThere are many apple watch versions of the apps that are on the AppStore This is useful because you can keep track of app specific features with ease\\n\\nSetup was extremely quick and easy Opening the packaging actually takes more time than the setup itself Setup and pairing consist of you pointing your phone\\x92s camera at a fancy QR code Then the rest is automatically done by your phone\\n\\nThe watch comes with two adjustable bands It comes with a short band and a long band The charger is usbc to magnet which is included though it\\x92s only the cable Not the power brick\\x85\\n\\nThe battery life on the apple watch is pretty good i find myself having to stick it on the charger once every 23 days It also charges relatively quick which is nice\\n\\nOverall i\\x92d like to recommend this watch to people who are working on staying fit or people who simply want to spend less time on their phones but still receive their phone notifications in a less distracting manner It works really good and I haven\\x92t had any problems with so far I love Apple products this is my third watch my first one was destroyed in a bicycle accident My series 3 is still good but can no longer be updated so I opted for the Series 7 Could not be happier This watch has the features for heart beats per minute blood oxygen levels and ECG These are great for heart issues Also the phone answering capability is really helpful I originally was hesitant to purchase this Apple Watch on Amazon however it was on sale during Prime days Came quickly as always from Amazon and was in the original Apple packaging Very happy to have this latest Apple Watch at a discounted price Everything is great about this version but battery live Why not better capacity batteries after 7 generations of this product This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it A good true item Most pleased with watch If you have an older watch then you\\x92ll definitely notice the differences fast I upgraded from the 4 to this one I must say I\\x92m impressed I would consider it worth it if you\\x92re looking to upgrade Battery life is wayyyy better Text keyboard is my fav upgrade I kept going back and forth as to whether I should order this watch and was hesitant to order in online rather than go into and Apple dealer I am in LOVE with this watch and wish I had pulled the trigger earlier It is super userfriendly and has so many functions that are easy to learn to use It pairs up with my Peloton and shows me my heart rate and automatically adds my workout to my rings This totally motivates me to workout each day as you add other people with Apple watches to share your workout and it notifies you when one of your friends worked out It encourages you to keep moving and gives you praise for closing your rings each day The bands are easy to change and the battery stays charged all day and then charges pretty quickly on the charger that is sold separately If mine broke tomorrow I would order another one with no hesitation Great for use with my phone I can do just about everything I do with phone alone It\\x92s like a phone on my wrist I\\x92ve had 4  fitbits the 4th stopped working customer service didn\\x92t help  so I moved to Apple Apple doesn\\x92t have as nice of sleep tracking however Apple calls 911 if you fall I love the screen it just looks great and the fitness tracking is great I love closing my rings and the 45mm is a great size My last iPhone was the 5s Since then Ive been die hard Samsung and fell in love with the Note series with the Note 9 being my most recent Samsung phone Id bought a Gear S3 and it was an awesome watch but after switching to an iPhone 12 Pro Max I discovered that the two didnt work so well together Some functions are fine but I wanted to be able to respond to texts and phone calls from my watch if necessary and couldnt with the Samsung watchiphone combination\\n\\nAfter doing a lot of research I decided I wanted the latest Apple watch available I found this one which was used and described as being in good condition If it has been used however I cant tell because there are no scratches or other outward signs of use on it It even came in Apple watch packaging with the wireless watch charger\\n\\nBattery life seems to be good so far although Ive turned off the always on display If Im not looking at it I dont need it to be on and if I do look at it the display comes on so in my opinion anything beyond that is a waste of battery life I like the ekg and blood oxygen functions Changing faces editingaddingremoving complications from the home screen is easy Syncing the watch to my phone was as easy as pointing my phones camera at the watch face One of the best things about it is how seamlessly everything flows together in the Apple ecosystem\\n\\nIm sure there will be minor annoyances or things I dont like later on down the road but as of now its quite a few notches above my old Gear watch and a welcome and useful addition to my phone I got this watch in a deal I think o made a good decision It arrived with a good packaging and good shape I wear it all the time and track my workout I can also make and receive calls and see all the notifications Only complaint is the battery life isn\\x92t that good but other than that solid so far I love this watch I waited patiently for this color to become available on Prime Days Worth the \\x93watch\\x94 The series 7 is so much better than the 3 for reading and using it for more applications Going to a 41mm made all the difference from the 38 on my series 3 The commercials like to say this watch Apple Watch 7 is the most scratch proof of the watches I had mine less than 2 months big scratch down the middle I\\x92m disabled and don\\x92t leave the house often I only wear when I go out It got scratched So don\\x92t believe the hype it\\x92s scratch proof There are many more features on the Apple Watch than a Fitbit The older I get the more I appreciate the health tracking options Like everything except the band I might pre fee a cloth and velcro May look for one of those but not a deal breaker I set up my watch and found out that a full charge lasted me less than SIX HOURS I knew there was no way this was right\\n\\nIf you are having issues like this make sure you\\n1 Update the watch\\n2 Unpair and reset the watch\\n3 Pair again\\n\\nThis helped me to fix whatever issue the watch was having and now the battery life is fantastic Maybe there was an error when I first paired it\\n\\nEverything else is as advertised great watch The wristband that came with it is hard to put on your wrist other than that I Love my apple watch Bought a new stretchy band love the fact you can buy all kinds and colors of wristbands at a reasonable price I love the heart app and like that the face stays on constantly unlike older models Lots of new apps for this mod Love my watch Helps me to move more and to keep up with my health readings Also I can answer phone calls and messages without looking for my phone muy bonito reloje y perfecto para mi esposa Everything works fine Gave it to my wife and she loved it Although her last Apple Watch one was pink the silver is still pretty nice I love my Apple Watch 7 but I can\\x92t sleep with it because the battery is of short duration so I charge in the night I would love to track my sleep I have sleep apnea so it would be very helpful if I can track my sleep  Purchased used through Amazon warehouse Save a few hundred and found no issues However it did not qualify for Apple care because of the original purchase date I opened an Apple Care support and brought it into the Apple Store to run their diagnostics and verifications A few hours later I was able to purchase Apple Care for this device Technically paying for extended warranty is not required but I want to protect my purchase I\\x92m really enjoying learning the capabilities of the watch It\\x92s definitely a life enhancer\\nMy only wish is for a printed manual that I could leaf through Love it My son has been trying for quite some time to get me to get one I finally agreed Boy was he correct The features are amazing I love the features Highly recommend Great product Good watch Love it Cant really say how the watch is since unaware to me the Block USBC  as Im now seeing it called is not included Honestly charge a bit more to begin with and include it Wouldnt you think when the description says charging cord included it would also have the plug connection Had to wait 2 more days to get that before I could start to set it up and see how everything works It arrived today and now its almost finished charging so hopefully all will go smoothly now Fingers crossed Bought this to track my health and keep me focused Perfect for work when you cannot have your phone out I love the watch Comfortable on my wrist fits well Great for fitness tracking as well as time date etc etc This is my third watchall have performed very well Only upgraded after 2 years of usethey only get better Fantastic I wasn\\x92t sure what to expect when I purchased this watch but I am impressed with all it can do Great It\\x92s absolutely worth the money especially when you can get it for way less on Amazon I got the product red it stands out very well People say that the 45mm is too big for a small wrist but mine fits great on my somewhat small wrists The bigger screen will come in handy It\\x92s easier to type on or simply just using calculator app I use nearly all the features The best Im a senior and I fell down My watched buzzed on my wrist and asked if I needed an SOS Perfect and what I bought this watch for I was fine I also use the sleep and exercise which keeps track of everything Love it Nice display Great watch Like the increase in size from the series3 and the bands still are interchangeable It\\x92s an Apple Watch It\\x92s good will continue to be good Great price can\\x92t say enough good things about it Well doesnt the time say it all its a great product just wish my wife would be ok with it she works for Samung and hates apple I personally like both Samsung and Apple Accurate and nice Only reason it doesn\\x92t have 5 stars is because I didn\\x92t receive the correct band color I ordered the one with the midnight band and received the abyss blue instead Watch works perfectly I couldn\\x92t be happier with it just that one small issue I believed that since it did not come directly from Apple it was fake or it would not serve well BUT IT IS TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME IT IS SUPER COMFORTABLE QUALITY AND MOST OF ALL DURABLE Ive been eyeing out for the right deal and I found that it was the time that I should purchase an Apple Watch Though its a bummer that the power brick did not come with this watch given the price point that it already is I dont know why Apple says there are trying to help the environment by limiting these important features when we have to pay again just to realize there is no power brick in the box\\n\\nAnother downside is that if your want to stream music from your Apple Watch from a thirdparty streaming service such as Spotify it WONT work You will need to buy the cellular version if you want to stream music from your watch Otherwise this regular watch will only act as a remote for your iPhone\\n\\nAnyways on the bright side this watch helps me stay active and reminds me to get up once in a while So Ive been using this watch for the minimum such as reading emails writing reminders walking sleep tracking and so on I ordered 3 apple watches on prime day I have heard horror stories of people never receiving their items and just empty boxes I never though this would happen to me 23 apple watches were in their boxes with charges and the wrist bands The third box was just a part of the band Thank god I called product services to let them know They took care of my issue immediately and were patient with me I was so worried and honestly a little ticked off that my item was missing But thankfully everything is working on and a replacement is otw Purchased for my husband He had previously owned several Fitbit trackers Loves his Apple Watch with all its apps Got a good deal on Prime Day so I thought I\\x92d try it Took a bit to get the face I liked Battery life is less than I expected Less than 2 days Little by little I\\x92m figuring out how to use Thank goodness for YouTube videos because it came with very little instructions Sleep tracking gives different info than my Fitbit did Still learning Haven\\x92t had it too long  I enjoy wearing my Apple watch series 7\\nOne thing I believe it can be improved is it\\x92s heart rate sensor and accuracy\\n\\nNo matter how I wear the Apple watch or which hand I put it on It takes a few minutes for the heart rate to be displayed The more concerning part is at the high intensity stage of my workout like an uphill run the heart rate put out by my applet watch is consistently significantly lower than that measured by my Fitbit Versa or ionic watch\\nThe attached photos show the comparison between my Apple Watch series 7 and my Fitbit Versa 2 on the same outdoor run I like the new screen way bigger than my 3 I really like the stay on display too I\\x92m very happy treated myself Always wanted one I so do not regret this purchase Now an Apple Watch user for life I especially like the ecg oxygen sensor and fall detector I also appreciate the long battery life it has I love everything about this watch except the battery life I have changed the setting to not have the screen on constantly and I even put it in theater mode often to save on battery and it still doesn\\x92t last a full 24 hrs It has about a third of the battery life that my series 3 did The charger also doesn\\x92t have a usb end like most other Apple devices and doesn\\x92t come with a charging block If Apple is going to change it up again they should include the block I just use the charger from my old watch since all my blocks are usb\\nI\\x92ve worn it in the pool and it still works great so it\\x92s actually waterproof Cellular works with no problems The EKG and oxygen levels are a nice addition\\nYou can set it to alert 911 if you fall but I\\x92ve turned it off because it had called 911 twice on me Once while washing dishes and once while changing the band My heart doctor suggested I buy an Applewatch after having a couple of procedures Said heart apps were great way to monitor heart activity He was right The blood oxygen and ECG apps are easy to use and accurate Heart Rate app keeps me updated on what my heart is doing and gives me the option to send results to my doctor I like the fact that I can take phone calls from nearby cell phone and receive emails and text Didnt have plans or desire to buy a Apple watch but glad I did This was a great gift She loves it She wears it all the time If battery was longer would give 5 stars Excelente equipo Rápido ágil pantalla muy buena resolución simplemente excelente muy contento no le doy 5 es por no incluir el adaptador si que son misersbles El vendor se lleva 5 estrellas eficiente rapido y equipos de calidad gracias I love that it has full screen display Makes it seem so much larger than the series 3 My family got this for my mom and she loves it Everything works great This is the nicest smart watch I ever owned it\\x92s amazing how accurate the watch is for tracking my heart breath and sleeping I bought 41mm apple watch till now as for my experience it is pretty good in all prospective but battery life is not much satisfactory Sleep tracking is also not much accurate or satisfactory Excellent watch Love all the health stuff Many options to make it your own style Speakers low Battery life only  a day Quick charge Does not come with special adapter for charging Bought extra \\x93brick\\x94 through Apple on Amazon I love it and more that I got the discount on a prime day the big difference with the series three that I have before flatter and the screen is more significant more space to see everything on your watch I got this for the ECG heart app Really helps w tracking my issues Got it in Prime day at a great buy  Love it  Great watch Super stylish and tracks all I need You do have to charge it every other evening so be prepared for that Plus it needs a unique charger Me encanto el precio en descuento en ese momento nunca desaprovechar una oferta Battery life is great all tracking features have been an asset great Apple product I just upgraded from a 1st gen Apple Watch to Series 7 WOW What an improvement The heartbeat blood H2O and ECG apps are simply amazing features Also I love the new colors improved face templates and the band has been improved Really happy with the purchase I like the activity tracker and text messages right to my watch All this technology right on my wrist Love it Don\\x92t remember how I ever did without it At a glance access to time temperature heart rate date and most importantly the current price of Tesla stock Easy to track exercising First and foremost  Be aware the the less expensive aluminum models do NOT have sapphire glass instead they have a relatively soft ion strengthened glass that scratches and scuffs incredibly easy from even the most incidental contact Its unacceptable IMO for a smartwatch that retails over 400 which the 45 does If I ever get another Apple Watch it will 100 be on the higher end casings that actually have sapphire glass Friends have stainless steel and their watches are 100 scratch free after a year while my aluminum model is already scuffed and looks second hand after 2 months In marketing and descriptions from Apple it reads like all models have the sapphire glass unless you read the fine print this is just a PSA for those considering the aluminum\\n\\nAs for the Apple Watch on its own merits I love it The sleep tracking is basically nonexistent and the battery needs to be charged every day but the other functions and the user experience are spectacular I just cant wholeheartedly recommend the aluminum models for the average person to keep on their wrist day after day as their main watch it scuffs just by living Love the watch using it to track my activities\\nRecommend this watch Fitbit to Apple Difficult to program  understand Have to charge every night so I dont get important vitals at night Fitbit battery last 45 days I love everything about this watch except for the battery life I love that their are so many apps on it Great watch Girlfriend loves it says it\\x92s even better than her previous model Very nice watch keeps track of your heartbeat blood pressure Exactly what I expected from an I watch by apple So far works great No problems with an Apple watch Like the bright red color This is a fantastic watch I was hesitant about getting one of these figuring I would destroy it as it big and my watches usually get beat up I found a heavy duty watch band an that seems to have helped This has more features than I will use I like the Navigation and how it syncs up to my phone The heart monitoring apps are nice too and the now playing app that allows me to control the phone and ear pods I wish the compass would work with the metal watch case but I will have to remove it if I need to use the compass The only thing I don\\x92t care for is the battery life I usually have to change it every night If I am out camping where I need the compass and navigation having to change it nightly will be an issue The keyboard is tiny but they made an effort to put one on there As usual its an overpriced Apple product It works as advertised However it has some minor glitches such as keeping track of heart rate Sometimes it works sometimes it gives wrong numbers when checking heart rate This particular watch was a present to my daughter I do prefer Android based watches as the choice of watches is much better than Apple watches Anniversary present to my husband He loved it Got this watch to answer phone calls and be able to show that indeed did read The bonus is the surprising keyboard that is a step up from active two from Samsung The other features including being able to do much more It\\x92s been several years but hoping watch technology keep on improving I like to be able to take phone calls on it I love this watch it is everything I expected it to be Great watch Does everything I need it to do The case I have on it doesn\\x92t allow me to type texts very wellbut that\\x92s not the watches fault I definitely recommend Love this Wear it all the time Love the Apple Watch I have to charge it daily even when it not mirroring my IPhone picked up for wife as she broke her 5 it had a great run\\n\\nloves it way more screen for the same size shes very little\\n\\ngreat battery life Already had a series 4 for three years before breaking it This is the newest in the series and the always on display does make this a better product for me\\n\\nThere are other additional features like better battery life but this is still needing to be charged once a day The fast charging is nice though because as long as I charge it while I get ready in the morning it will always make it through the day\\n\\nIf you have a series 3 or earlier this is a worthwhile upgrade If you\\x92re series 4 or later just wait until yours is broken I love my new watch it\\x92s an upgrade from\\nI watch 5 Oxygen level keeps me informed if too low Battery life is great  Charging is faster too  Great Buy\\nThank you Amazon Being disabled senior this is my life line If I fall I get help I can call anyone And great for reminders I love my watch every senior should have one I feel safer Great watch at a great price Amazing I watch\\x85 just loved it  Helps keep track of my exercise Expected battery life to be longer Love this watch and as the title says best purchase ever My husband loves his watch I have an older version that he bought me a few years ago He has never had an Apple Watch and he loves it And at a discounted price it is great The updated heart monitor is wonderful and very easy to read Great watch to wear daily Battery does not hold as much of a charge as my series 4 model in the beginning but still has the great looks as the Apple series 4 Great addition to iPhone if like myself can not have your phone on you while at work The Apple Watch solves many of these challenges Great to find this version of the Apple Watch at a lower price I love it If my phone isn\\x92t in my hand then I still know I have messages or can answer a call with the watch Great little gadget This watch does everything you want or need to do I wear it while paddling on the dragon boat and have no issues with monitoring or recording exercise The husband is Happy with it Love some of the extra features on the watch Really enjoying learning all it has to offer me Bought this for my wife She loves it This is my third apple watch as features are added I am enticed to upgrade Pass the old ones to my kids who love them as well \\x95 Better than 24 hour battery with light use\\n\\x95 Cardiac functions O2 EKG and BPM are handy\\n\\x95 Always on display\\n\\nPhoto with Barton NATO strap Received it mail lady delivered to wrong box Very nice watch easy to setup This is my 2nd Apple Watch and I love it\\nIt was time to upgrade and I found this on sale on prime day and jumped Very useful Just started using the Fitness app Easy to text and answer and end phone calls Connects with AirPod pros Waterproof swimproof Definitely worth the money The battery life and fast charging is implicit My cardiologist recommended me to get this watch to help monitor my AFib I\\x92ve had it a week now and I\\x92m still learning things about it\\x85\\nMy only complaint is it doesn\\x92t come with the \\x93brick\\x94 to plug your charger into There is only one advantage to Fitbit battery life Everything else this is far superior and a greater value Worked flawlessly from day 1 It feels very light when you wear it on your hand It has a stylish appearance and enough functions I like it very much Received fast and very nice new series 7 You get a summary for each day and a running average on the app I\\x92m 81 and it certainly nice to have something that keeps track of all that information The Apple Watch is user friendly great for activity tracking and a great way to stay connected without constantly having a phone in hand A gift from my husband While I don\\x92t approve of spending that much money on a watch it\\x92s been nice to have My only complaint is that it has to be charged nightly or it\\x92ll die the next day I did drop it on concrete and it didn\\x92t scratch or crack so that\\x92s a plus I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife She loves it She doesnt have to constantly be looking at her cell phone for notifications they come to her phone She loves the Health Tracker App for daily excersize and activities I\\x92ve always wanted one Love the Apple Watch  best product that I have perched this year Only flaw is the batterie doesn\\x92t last more than one day other than that super easy to use very convenient apps love this product\\x85 Thanks to reading the reviews I was prepared You have make an extra purchase for the connector to charge the watch The battery life is the worst but the watch is exceptional Otherwise Loving it so far Me gusta la carga rápida y la amplitud de su pantalla vengo de tener el Watch 4 y la experiencia es superior Another great product by Apple This watch is fantastic for health conscious This actually promotes health  encourages to increase physical activities I\\x92ve had the series 3 for four years It was time to upgrade Apple makes an excellent product and during Amazon Prime specials I purchased one There is no comparison to the Apple Watch for quality Love it Got this on amazon day Good deal Saved me when my iPhone\\x92s screen didn\\x92t work Was able to use it to calltxt etc Battery can last two days  Very easy to use but idk if it is comfortable for sleeping it\\x92s pretty bulky Amazing product Everything I like it as a watch  phone My son wanted me to have it for my health  safety Everyday use I don\\x92t wear it to bed All else I like except for the battery life\\nNeeds to be charged every evening Actualizando mi nuevo reloj y junto a él mi viejo series 5 Aun no pruebo a tope el rendimiento de la batería pero traeré una actualización pronto Excelente reloj aunque es poca la diferencia física con respeto al cambio del 5 al 7 I kept going back and forth on either the Apple Watch or the new Fitbit What came down to it was the Apple Watch did not require me to have a monthly subscription to use all its healthfitness tracking services and I have all apple products so it links up to all my\\nelectronics\\nOnly down side to using all the health and fitness monitoring is I have to charge it daily Good thing it charges super fast\\nI take it off in the morning as I get ready for the day let it charge and then put it on before My day starts\\nI love it and understand why so many people said I should get one I don\\x92t regret it Also glad I bought the screen protector it\\x92s helped on multiple occasions The band color is \\x93starlight\\x94 sounds like a ehite color In addition the band appears to be white in picture It is in fact tanbeige I needed white so now I need to order an extra band This is a great watch it does everything the battery life is limited cant go for two day if it is not recharged over night will run out of power I still love it Update 4 weeks later the errors have not reoccurred\\nOnly had this New watch a few days and for no reason my customized Home Screen icons changed all at the same time\\nBatter level changed to heart rate\\nTotal daily step count changed to world clock\\nJellyfish background changed to generic clock face\\nYes battery was charged  never came close to fully drained This new watch is better all around battery life glass screen apps A great Apple Watch at a good price I was shocked at how terrible the battery life is especially compared to my Garmin Fenix I think it\\x92s ridiculous that the watch has to be charged every single day Obviously charging it overnight would be the easiest thing to do but then you miss out on the sleep tracking\\n\\nThat said now that I have an iPhone I do prefer how this watch interacts with the phone compared to my Garmin Awesome technology This watch can do it all Love it so much Love that you spend less time checking your phone And it encourages you to move more and pushes you to keep reaching for goals Really recommend anyone to get a watch that tracks your movements Easy to use I\\x92m not very tech savvy The new health features available only in this latest series seven convinced me to upgrade from an earlier version WatchOS upgrades are also very good Ive also found battery life to be better than my older version Nothing competes with an Apple Watch  it is the best by far Got it in the prime day sale 330 for series 7 45 mm watch is a steal of a deal Perfect Easy to set up apps are great and the cellular option is awesome for long runs so you don\\x92t have to lug your phone around 41mm size is great for most people Overall very happy Awesome product I like it Good UI and connectivity with my phone and on its own Apple taking over the world I like that it vibrates on my wrist when I receive a call and that I can see the time in daylight I\\x92m slowly learning how to do it all Like Apple Watch better than my Fitbit but both are good It works great My last one was good but this one is better Very good watch and quality is amazing My husband lost his watch on vacation so got this one It\\x92s very nice and has cool features I mainly got it for her for the sleep tracking but she uses it monitor health and steps per day This Apple Watch is great Perfect for my needs Dis mf lit as hell but tbh it\\x92s pretty useless but I like the way it looks Everything works great does everything it says I love it I went from fitbit to this watch Big big difference of course I use the wallet exercise messages features I even did maps The navigation was a little obnoxious when it came to telling me to turn in a certain direction but I won\\x92t have an excuse to miss a turn now Love it Mostly used with health apps  Also convenient to see important message without holding phone  This watch is very clear fast updated and a great overall watch But the battery life blows I\\x92ll start wearing it at 8am and it\\x92ll be dead by 6pm I\\x92ve turned off apps notifications and whatever else and it still blows Even wearing it overnight on sleep mode it\\x92s like almost dead in the morning If you have model 6 Apple Watch there are very few reasons to upgrade I only upgraded mine because to model 7 because my previous watch fell on tile and cracked the screen Otherwise its a good overpriced Apple product well ahead of any competition not much to add here Worked right out of the package and easy set up The battery life is just short I love this watch many great features I went from a 3 to this 7 big different and great deal Awesome watch but would recommend to get a case for it Other than that love it My Mom debated about upgrading her iWatch since the 7 came out When I saw Prime Day had such an amazing deal on it I told her She had me buy it for her asap It arrived 3 days later and she is loving it No one else could touch that price and she is so happy so has it now So thanks Amazon my only dislike is the difficulty of texting on the watchI need to use siri Did not know if I would like it but now I wear it every day Love it Upgraded from a Series 3 Apple watch and very happy with the new watch and its capabilities I don\\x92t like that without an adapter I cannot charge my watch Bought this watch for my wife\\x92s birthday she absolutely loves it I bout this watch on prime day for an outstanding deal The next day I had to go to the phone store and they were charging double of what I paid The watch is amazing I am not able to have my phone at work so this watch allows my kids to always be in contact with me I really enjoy the fitness tracker and use it to track my workouts There are some important features expected for the money I was expecting to get more monitoring functions to provide complete vital but simple data for immediate emergency evaluation by first responders doctors specialist and primary physician avoiding waste of time that saves more lives especially to weak elderly with vulnerable delicate complicated and worsening health conditions for the pice paid to this device\\nA new and updated apple iPhone was also purchased to achieve the full the limited functionality and incomplete data\\x92s\\nThe unexpected expenses superseded the maximum amount budgeted amount Upgraded to the 7 from the 3 and I am so impressed and pleased with these upgrades As someone that suffers from tachycardia and vertigo frequently I love how I can keep track of my o2 sat and ecg It alerts me to high heart rates and if I fall from my vertigo I feel better knowing that it can send an emergency alert if I need it The face display is way bigger than the 3 and I love it Storage is also way bigger and I can download a lot more apps battery life is great and charging is fast I am so happy I finally got the series 7 best investment and I use it everyday This new Apple Watch is outstanding The features and health monitoring is amazing It does everything I need it to do As a diabetic it alerts me for highlow blood sugars with the App and vibrates to do this Very important for me Great buy So happy I upgraded my Apple Watch Everything I hoped it would be I fell in yard and I was able to call for help right away Excellent buy Todo bien tamaño funciones estética Batería es otro tema Pero en general insuperable I love being able to track my steps especially when I go on my outside walks I can check my texts and notifications I wish the battery life was longer I\\x92m still trying to figure out how all of the different functions work  Very attractive blue watch Like it a lot more then my Apple 4 watch Love this watch Makes me keeping track of health issues very painless I purchased the watch to pair it with my iPhone and quite honestly very happy I did Muy buen equipo I like it I like it a lot Not nearly as cumbersome as I thought it would be Still getting used to the watch I am enjoying the watch Got this during prime days and the savings were great Very happy  does everything it is advertised to do\\nBought the cellular version Well worth the few extra bucks ATT charges 10 a month plus tax to add it to your IPhone account Enjoying my watch Good watch I really like it but don\\x92t feel like it\\x92s really waterproof for some reasonOther than that it\\x92s great I recommend it My wife and I purchased 2 Apple Watches and wear them everyday Probably most interesting to us is the sleep tracking capabilities We compare nearly every morning and feel it\\x92s pretty accurate We also track our fitness and our pulse I\\x92m glad we didn\\x92t spend extra and get the GPS option We almost always have our phone with us and the watches connect so easily that all the functions we use are readily available Glad we have them Deducting one star because so far  I\\x92m just concerned because the apple packaging appeared to be opened prior to my receiving and opening it I did not purchase a preused item I purchased a brand new item I will need to boot the watch and test to see if there is anything off Will update this review soon When I was in grade school calculator watches were the envy of tech people like me Never could I have imagine I\\x92d one day own a watch like this\\n\\nI am amazed that so much functionality is packed into such a small device I really appreciate the medical features I am glad I put off buying an Apple Watch until the series 7 The screen is amazing The watch also charges very quickly\\n\\nI ended up buying the starlight version I was disappointed that Amazon was out of the black watch but one of the neat features of the Apple Watch is the ability to replace the bands By the way the sports bands are so comfortable\\n\\nOne thing that\\x92s important to know before you buy an Apple Watch is the charger requires a USBC port It\\x92s a good thing I bought a battery bank that has a USBC port a few weeks before or I\\x92d have no way to charge my watch Love being able to take calls while away from my phone The watch looks good i like that i can change the face to multiple faces what i dont like is that the battery must be charged every day Love my Apple Watch except battery doesn\\x92t seem to last long before needs recharging Watch is very comfortable and works well battery could do to be longer I get about a day and a half with always on display turned off It was exactly what I expected and came super fast I love my watch It is awesome So glad I bought it Clearer screen  like the phone in it for emergencies Battery life is great no problem s I use this item for work and love all the features What can you say Apple does it right There\\x92s only two things I don\\x92t like about the watch so far so I\\x92ll start with that The first is while listening to Spotify on my phoneheadphoneshelmet if the dial spins on the watch it changes the volume It\\x92s the worst while riding my motorcycle because holding the handlebars causes the dial to spin even when the watch display is off So I\\x92ll be riding and then blow my eardrums out because it scrolls to max volume I haven\\x92t figured out a way to turn it off if there is one The other thing I don\\x92t like is that there\\x92s no built in step counter It relays on your cellphone for that when every other watch style device has one and costs way less\\n\\nThere\\x92s plenty of things I love about it so far though It\\x92s great for phone calls and texting without your phone Or seeing whos calling while your on a bikemotorcycle And the durability is great I play a ton of sand volleyball and it\\x92s great at keeping the sand out of it Since I swim with it as well I wasn\\x92t surprised but I was really happy with that Works great fantastic display Very functional Should have bought the cellular model and gone for the full Monty Battery life much better and healthy features like ecg are amazing I\\x92m still learning on how to use it I wore the series 3 for about 4 years and the settings on this baby keep me interested I\\x92m basically pleased with my new watch except for 2 issues The battery charge is too short After syncing my phone and watch i no longer get notifications of texts and sometimes phone calls My husband and I both have tried to correct this to no avail Good features Phone connection good Charges quickly I got this watch on sale for prime day and although it took it some time to get to me it\\x92s an amazing watch To top it off the starlight color is to die for Llegó súper rápido nuevo totalmente con su caja sellada So far like everything it does I like everything about this watch I love this watch with all its capabilities It was also the best price I have found after shopping around Love that it saves passwords now Battery life still isn\\x92t great if you\\x92re a reader The kindle app puts a drain on it Overall I like it I like everything on this watch The need to recharge the watch in 24 hours I love my new watch It\\x92s exactly what I ordered Purchased as a 25th birthday present She loved it Love it easy to use Great product Love my new watch Unfortunately I returned my watch The band was extremely uncomfortable and hurt my wrist There was also missing sleep data three different nights I could not imagine wanting to wear it enough to get my moneys worth Honestly I thought I was getting a deal for it  but I picked the wrong color and I paid full price Regardless I dont know what Im doing with it and it feels like an expensive mistake So I had a Fitbit and have used one for the past 7 years I loved everything about Fitbit from the simplistic ease of use to the excellent stats it kept to the battery life about a week usually\\n\\nI had the Ionic which was recently recalled I never had an issue with it but I\\x92d had it for almost 3 years and thought if they\\x92re going to refund me what I paid 3 years ago I might as well try an Apple Watch All in all I spent less than 100 for the 45mm Series 7\\n\\nFirst impressions I hated it It\\x92s got waaaaay more functionality than a Fitbit and that\\x92s not necessarily a good thing It\\x92s too much if you\\x92re looking for a step counter sleepheart rateactivity monitor Fitbit uses ONE app to easily display all the pertinent info you need Apple Watch uses no fewer than THREE different apps  Fitness Watch and Health  to monitor info andor change watch displays You can also download more apps to monitor things such as sleep It\\x92s not complicated but it\\x92s overly complicated and cumbersome Apple should seriously consider hiring some people away from Fitbit and take some advice Oh and the battery life is absolute trash compared to Fitbit I have to charge it every 2436 hours depending on usage The good thing is that it does charge super fast but I guess it probably should considering the capacity is so awful\\n\\nIt\\x92s basically an iPhone shrunk down to wear on your wrist It has some interesting functionality such as makingreceiving calls and you can send texts from it although the screen and keyboard are so small it\\x92s best to use the precanned responses rather than try to type out an actual message\\n\\nI could go on and on but I\\x92ll try to sum it up If you\\x92re a longtime Fitbit user keep using Fitbit unless you just want to try something new But beware Even after two weeks of the Apple Watch I was considering sending it back but I\\x92m sticking it out When it dies I\\x92ll probably go back to Fitbit unless they\\x92re out of business or Apple makes some much needed changes to streamline it and improve the battery life\\n\\nHighly overrated the only issue is battery life I have to charge it every night before bed timebut its worth it\\x85 I\\x92ve been doing research on my health condition about congestive heart failure\\x85 I suffered a cardiac arrest last year and comatose for 5 days and recovering but I needed a device that will monitor my daily routine so I watched video of people who experienced sudden heart attack This watch is perfect for me\\x85 Big upgrade Nice smart watch I like watch Short battery life when apps are used Like band replacement Need more waterproof features Great for health and exercise Counts steps tracks heart rate and blood oxygen So convenient If I\\x92m in one room and my phone\\x92s in another room I can answer a call on the watch rather than running to the other room to get my phone User manual is really long but you will find many useful tips in it Needs to be charged every other day Battery life not great Better than I expected I\\x92m learning more functions every day but I\\x92m unhappy with the battery life I feel like I\\x92m always charging it 48hrs is all I get between charges value for money purchase Very pleased with it Easy to put together easy to pair my iPhone easy to put the straps on \\x85I started wearing it the moment I put it together\\x85 very happy with the product\\x85 I\\x92m delighted that it\\x92s waterproof and large screen is amazing I love the retina feature it\\x92s really cool My wife loves it no more to be said Great product Good value My wife has an Apple phone she wanted to get the newest watch on the market by Apple She loves it got it for her birthday gift Bought this for my wife Ive had a 6 watch for awhile now and no issues Expect same great performance but not giving five stars because Apple cut corners on this one and did not provide the USBC adapter to allow charging out of the box So had to spend another 20 to get adapter to use charging cord that comes with the watch This is an example of the stupid stuff companies like Apple do to their customers Instead of providing the 20 adapter with the watch yes just add it to the cost they play stupid games like this I just hope they did not cut corners on the tech in this watch Bought this as a gift for my bf The battery life is great and delivered by promised day Got a great deal for prime day as well This watch is way better than previous generations Great battery life sleep tracking and is an absolute catalyzer to working out and getting healthier What is there to really say it\\x92s an apple seven watch it is what it is lol that\\x92s not generic it\\x92s not fake ass it\\x92s really Apple I have had zero problems with my watch and it works exactly how it should I got in on a Prime Day Deal and I love it Got this during prime day for almost 30 off and works like charm You can never complain about apple products and this is one of the better ones Loving it Best smart watch easy to set up and load everything from my iphone to watch Whats not to like its Apple We caught them on sale 32900 Su precio Excelente producto Shipping fast good deal Love it Great item I found the series 7 watch to be a nice upgrade from the series 3 The heart rate app works much better I like the large screen that can continually display I found that the Battery life is improved as well I originally purchased the 45mm since during a sale it was only 6 more expensive than the 41mm When I put it on it was laughably way too big on my wrist Imo it\\x92s really meant for a bulky man I returned for the 41mm and so glad I did Looks much more appropriate on my wrist Also this is an upgrade for me from the series 3 and I\\x92m blown away by the improvements made If you\\x92re on the fence about upgrading just do it Nice watch\\nYes I know that Apple doesn\\x92t supply power blocks anymore\\nBut I didn\\x92t know you need a USBC block\\nNow I got a dead watch until a get a chance to go buy one\\n\\nI guess I\\x92ll be wearing the Fitbit today\\nThanks I love my new Apple Watch Currently using it to track my sleep and activity levels If you want to keep up with your health better this is the way to go Also makes replying to messages and getting notifications less annoying No le dura nada la batería por el precio esperaba algo más pero la verdad no tiene mucha diferencia de los otros relojes inteligentes en el mercado que puedes conseguir hasta en la mitad de lo que cuesta este Muy buena aplicación I love my series 7 Apple Watch  Trying to get to know it better Any and everything needed right at my fingertips  It knows more about me than I do about myself  Learning about it more  love it  My husband was the recipient of this Apple Watch which he loves One of the main reasons for getting this watch is the fall factor My children wanted me to get a monitor for that purpose Now I have one Feel so safe I have spent many  over the years purchasing \\x93noname\\x94 brands of fitness watches None last more than a couple monthsI FINALLY got an Apple Watch So far so good but The blood pressure feature won\\x92t be available until 2023\\x85I\\x92ll be patient\\x85 Water Aerobic So excited to upgrade from series 2 to this series 7 It paired perfectly and I have had no issues with apps or performance BUT within 3 days I noticed a big scratch down the screen I\\x92ve worn that series 2 for years and no scratches I have not been any places or situations that I would expect to cause a scratch I\\x92m ordering a screen protector now But am highly disappointed that my long awaited upgrade has a flawed screen in 3 days good I have used my watch for several weeks now Its easy to wear and simple to use I have tried to use it to track my sleep but its not very accurate and I really dont like wear a watch to sleep The battery can only hold for 1 day It need to be charged everyday Sometimes I forgot to charge it and it will definitely power off the next day I can easily check messages and get notice by it which is good Overall I think its a good product for you if you plan to exercise and record second apple watch couldn\\x92t be happier Use for exercise La batería me dura hasta día y medio y carga bastante rápido me gusta que puedo estar checando las pulsaciones y la actividad de sueño puedo usarlo para controlar mi Roku y eso me gusta bastante Awesome item i sure he will like Birthday gift Everything that you can do with this phone is crazy I have been wanting one for long time Just upgraded from generation 1 so happy I did the face is improved and I love being able to access the health apps a plus apple makes great products what when you can a chance to save a few bucks like during prime days then it makes toys like this easy to obtain the watch is easy to setup and works seamless with your other apple products I like it This apple watch does not disappoint at all I love the many features its has  the look and the feel are amazing It is awesome to have almost all my phone apps in my wrist at all times I would think that a 300400 watch would come w a way to use the watch for more than 1 day NO POWER SUPPLY FOR THE POWER CORD TO PLUG INTOvery odd I guess my first Apple Watch has a learning curve  Doesn\\x92t stay charged more than 48 hrs at a time Original nuevo y excelente funcionamiento Its size is a bit small but ok I love this watch so much I purchased the Blue Aluminum Apple Watch 41mm  GPS only I purchased it from Amazon as \\x93Open boxlike new\\x94 and the watch came in perfect condition\\x85 nice savings of about 60 I also love how it matchescomplements my iPhone 12 Pro Max color I\\x92ve been obsessed with these colors ever since Apple released them So far the watch is working fine if anything changes I will update this review but this is a nice watch I got on prime day for a decent price Nothing Great but the OS doesnt support Whatsapp notifications not notification response interactions like the previous model Slightly bigger screen Improved battery life but not by much Easy wrist band changes\\nApple eco system and quality builds are elite in its own class Battery is a factor here Requires end of the day battery charging Overall great quality easy to connect to only IPHONES Love it best watch ever glad got it so happy I did wear all the time I love this watch It looks and feels great and the new features including the keyboard are all a lifesaver Highly reccommend communication with Iphone I would like to see more choice of time  temperature and date face  Didn\\x92t really like the choices I upgraded from the Series 3 to the Series 7 The series 7 is so much better The battery life is wonderful and it doesnt take long at all to charge He loves his gift it\\x92s what he wanted and enjoys it too Soo much mire than I expected and delivey an set up were seamless Really a great watch a must have The battery life screen size and additional apps available are huge improvements from my previous iWatch This is my first Apple Watch and I\\x92m really glad I went with this model It looks even nicer in person and has a lot of neat features The only thing I\\x92m not 100 happy with is the sleep tracking It is not as sensitive as my other watch not Apple and can be off by up to an hour I\\x92ve also noticed that if I wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep it may or may not go back to recording it It\\x92s not really that big of an issue to me because it still gives me a general idea and reminds me to go to sleep For the people complaining about not receiving a block\\x85 1 it explicitly states what comes in the box and 2 USB C to USB A adapters cost like 5 for a pack of 4 It\\x92s much more cost effective than buying a new block and if you place it in the same order as your watch you won\\x92t have to worry about waiting to charge it Super fast shipping and everything I upgraded from the Series 4 and it was so worth it Everything I loved about the series 4 this series 7 does it even better Plus I got more features Would recommend Moblie apps very helpful I have been looking at these since they came out I was worried it would turn into one of those tech items that I had to have only to sit there unused Ive had it a week and I really see myself using it all the time The only real drawback I see is the battery life When set to always on it has to be charged daily I would really like to see better battery life I needed help setting it up correctly not technology savvy but I do love the fact that I don\\x92t need to carry my phone anymore Updated from the series 4 and love this in the red so much great product instead of grabbing my phone out of my pocket i can just check it on my watch Got it the day before I went to the water park Fantastic Wore it all day at the park and then the river I love it Perfect The only complaint is it had to be charged every night Love the mobile aspect As a senior citizen it will alert if I fell A couple times I sat very hard and it asked if I fell I feel more comfortable living my life knowing that if I fall my watch will call someone Battery life is atrocious Won\\x92t last 24 hours Also the step counter and Appa to support exercise tracking are lousy If you want a good tracker and good battery life go with Garmin or one of the others If you want a mini phone on your wrist for text messaging and notifications this is what you want The watch itself delivered as promised with all the bells  whistles However the watchbands isn\\x92t good It doesn\\x92t stay clasped and nothing to hold the excess band in place buen producto Tracks all the things I care about custom for me Great value Awesome product For those wondering Amazon is a verified reseller Genuine apple watch amazing It is a bit heavy on my wrist but does exactly what it\\x92s suppose to do Super happy with my purchase it works great The battery life is awesome Battery does not last but a couple days other than that love the watch Love it I love mine I love how it watches my oxygen levels Buenísimo Lo único malo es que tardo 15 días en llegar pero se ve súper bien Ahora a aprender a usarlo jeje upgraded from the 5 to the 7 and im in love i have no bad reviews or thoughts on this apple watch I love my new Apple Watch series 7 It is a nice upgrade from the Apple Watch series 3 I enjoy the larger screen the \\x93always on\\x94 watch face and the chirps on the hour La verdad me emociones cuando lo vi muy bien estaba muy bien sellado todo no y viene todo completamente no falto nada  5 estrellas  what I like the most about this watch series 7 is this feature AlwaysOn Retina display also you can display photos also easy to change faces and wrist bands\\nbeats every other watch I changed from Galaxy 3 Perfect size and works great Highly recommend this apple product I lost my original Series 7 so I bought another one and cant live without it This one seems to have an updated OS none My wife is in love with this the size is Super All the apps were working fine but after two weeks the Watch stop working properly no color on any apps or photos Fue un regalo de cumpleaños para mi esposo le encantó la sorpresa I love what this smart watch has to offer I\\x92m able to track steps heart rate and blood oxygen as well as sleeping pattern Plus I stop missing calls and messages from my wife I bought the Apple watch for its ability to track bloodoxygen percentages and for the electrocardiogram feature What I use it for now is the original features that I wanted but much more like phone call notifications wrist telephone text notifications and many of the apps that are in my iphone although the small size of the screen makes using some of them challenging I am still finding more uses Bought it for my mother She loves it very much It is easy to setup especially for the people who did not very familiar with the smart application Case was sealed and everything seems to be good until I try to attach the band It was broken Texts and email notifications Tracking my miles  my heart rate The Apple Watch is exactly what I wanted and more Such great quality This is my first Apple Watch and I love it It really helps me monitor my vitals\\nThe only downside for me was that I\\x92ve had a really hard time connecting my watch to my cellular network I didn\\x92t realize that I needed to create another line on my cellular plan which costs another 10 a month That is my main problem right now Still trying to get it connected to the cellular carrier I have Great  Love my iwatch Battery lasts a couple of days if you are a light user Doesnt come with a charger which is just dumb but whatever Great price on these during Prime Day It is exactly what I wanted to replace my first series iWatch Love it Fast delivery and great packaging I previously owned a Apple Watch 3 and glad I upgraded to the iwatch 7 nice size \\x85 sldusolay great Play Video\\n\\xa0I was send the wrong color of watch and strap It was supposed to be navy blue watch and strap but was givin stainless steal The watch works perfectly fine and the strap does too just wish it was blue Got it yesterday I\\x92m blown away  I upgraded from a series 3 wow what a difference I\\x92m blown away so much better so much faster thank god for prime day got it at a 12000 discount  Lots of different functions Very useful for tracking different activities and it looks awesome My new series 7 Apple watch appeared to arrive DOA There was no way to start it or charge it because the magnetic charger terminated in a male USBC I am in the computer business and I had a female USBC to male USB adapter that I previously purchased from Amazon cost 7 for 2adapters I was then able to use the Apple charger to charge my new watch and set it up The adapter can then be used to charge the watch\\nPlease recommend that a female USBC to male USB adapter is purchased with new Apple watches The product is good but I wished it was placed in front of my door which it would have been hidden to passer Byers Not at the beginning of the porch A good watch for everyday excising Watch came brand new in sealed apple box Don\\x92t be afraid to order Watch came brand new with original box and paper work My wife loved it Got it in prime day It\\x92s perfect Started with series 1 4 6 now 7 Yay Absolutely love this watch for everything it does beside telling time This is my third I Watch Love them works great Love the watch and the delivery was fast I only use some of the features but the ones I\\x92ve grown used to are fantastic Being able to make quick replies to texts is wonderful and the voice to text works well when I need to go into detail\\n\\nSome things like the \\x93how long you have been standing\\x94 are horribly inaccurate Other things like your heart rate are pretty spot on My buddy has one and it told him his heart was having issues he went into the ER and found the watch was right bad news for him but at least it was discovered\\n\\nChecking weather or other functions are convenient but it\\x92s really a matter of how much you want to load onto your watch\\n\\nMy only real complaint is that the bands are on the small side Mine is in the second to last spot and in hot weather it will be on the last hole Apple might want to remember that more than women and children have interest in these\\n\\nLastly this is not a watch I would trust for everyday general wear unless the hardest thing you do is sit at a desk Sports outdoor chores and similar activities would probably kill this thing pretty quick Order received as promised no complaints about it however the box was opened not sure why hopefully this watch isn\\x92t used set it up into my iPhone and so far so good\\nKeep monitoring Wear it every day it looks good and can monitor the necessary indicators It would be nice if the battery was stronger But the flaws do not hide the good fivestar product Upgraded to a new Apple Watch and like the new features on the 7 compared to my 3 Great price from prime day Color is not recommended DEAD PIXEL I barely wore it left it home on active days Bought NEW from Amazon Apple will not replace the dead pixel Ive worn 3 used watches since Series 2 and never had a dead pixel I will NEVER buy a NEW Apple Watch again obviously They cant be trusted against manufacturer defects Always buy your Apple Watches from eBay so you know they wont have dead pixels appearing just after the 90day mark conveniently\\n\\nUPDATE I had to send it to Apple three times before they finally authorized a FORCED REPLACEMENT to correct the manufacturer defect Buy Apple Care or buy a used watch thats been vetted against MFG defects Does everything Love the fact I can take phone calls with it Great for exercise whether walking running or swimming Tracks heart rate EKG simply amazing Overall my husband is very pleased However Unlike my Apple Watch the charger does not have a USB on the end How is my husband supposed to charge his watch Simply love it Received on time as described I was able to immediately pair the watch with my iPhone without any issues My daughter loves and she loves the water features on it along with the health app AMAZON I LOVE YOU THIS IS WHY I KEEP AMAZON PRIME AND BUY EVERYTHING HERE\\nOK so guys I bought this watch via the warehouse used in good condition Ummm I honestly think someone bought this watch took of the shrink wrap opened it up said nah I dont like this color and then returned it to amazon\\n\\nI mean just about everything was still untouched Outside of the amazon renewed sticker on the front of the box and the scotch tape they used to close it up most of this interior was like a new unboxing experience The watch screen remained in its paper sleeve and the screen was immaculate The bands were not taken out and the charging puck was still in its packaging\\n\\nHeres I think the best part its still eligible for apple care  Because Apple gives you 60 days to add from the FIRST person to purchase the watch it was returned to amazon and sold so quickly to me I still have that chance as the second owner\\n\\nAs far as Im concerned I just bought a new apple watch 7 and saved a significant chunk of money Thank you Amazon My first smart watch Bought on prime day Absolutely love it  Thank you AMAZON Love my new watch and the speed of the deliver was INCREDIBLE in less than 10 hrs of my order I had it in my wrist  GO TO LOVE AMAZON Love it I don\\x92t think this Apple Watch is as good as my previous Apple Watch It doesn\\x92t seem to be able to keep track of whether or not I am standing or sitting and doesn\\x92t track my steps I have reset the app reset the Watch disconnected and reinstalled but doesn\\x92t change anything mentioned it keeps track of sleep and standing but keeps telling me to stand up even though I am still standing Very nice This is my favorite color Fast shipping Ive used an Apple watch for over five years now and my older one was showing its age in terms of compute power This new one is awesome  does everything the prior one does and more faster The only thing they don\\x92t tell you is it doesn\\x92t come with an adapter it should because it\\x92s not USB The watch is reliable It will not break or crack and is the latest model will always have your back Small piece of band was broken in box when installing the band it kept sliding right through CRAZY great price for an awesome watch Even my employee discount I had couldn\\x92t touch the Amazon deal I love the watch I love I dont have to carry my phone around the house with me\\nThe Health  Fitness tracker is great to keep me motivated to get up and move around Purchased the device for the purposes 1 to track sleep and 2 to avoid missing notifications when the phone is away\\n\\nGood\\n looks nice\\n charges fast you go to shower get back  fully charged but you need to use only the original charger\\n notifications are delivered effectively with images\\n Apple Pay works\\n like other Apple products has find me feature\\n\\nBad\\n heavy especially if you plan to sleep with it on\\n have to recharge every 24 hours\\n sleep tracking is weak because you must preconfigure sleep time range ie 9pm6am in the app otherwise feature does not work if you take a nap during the day it will not be counted if you have an unstable sleeping schedule and need to rely on the device with tracking your sleep  better use Fitbit\\n backward communication from the watch to iPhone say when you confirm a request in Authenticator app works unstably\\n\\nSummary\\nA very stylish gadget with convenient oneway access to notifications and simple builtin functions If lose it  and you may due to frequent recharge  you can always find it If you have requirements similar to mine consider a cheaper device If you desire Apple Watch for the sake of having another Apple product price is justified Easy 5 minute set up Great price as I have been looking for a deal It is everything that was promised Amazing Very nice This watch does it all  in a sleek beautifully designed package WAY better than my first gen Apple Watch fast info right on your wrist The best out there  period I call or my \\x93wrist Mac\\x94 because it has everything I need Overall its a good watch I was not happy that i wanted the 45mm but some how got the 41mm i think thats my fault when i placed the order i did not notice it Battery life is okay about a day or two of battery life before you have to charge it I have cameras and i can access my app turn lights on however i cant view the cameras I would like for that to be fixed Also when i receive pictures on whatsApp they appear blurry Just switched to iPhone from android for the first time and I had to try out the watch to go with it Love this thing cant go a day without it I liked mine so much that I made my mother and my wife both jealous so I bought both of them one too I really like challenging them on the fitness app Helps me push myself to exercise more I upgraded my Apple because the microphone stopped working and cellular is not much use unless you can speak Keeping the old watch to monitor sleep activity Very pleased So far I have enjoyed my Apple Watch would recommend I love my new Apple 7 watch The features are great and easy to use I love that I can have photos as my watch face Best purchase in a long time Produto excelente Many additional advantages Love my new watch quick shipment and easy to set up and operate It has many health features Phone quality is surprisingly good Liked the easy use of apps on the phone I especially liked the AFib monitor Excelente I had an Apple Watch SE before and I love this new upgrade The series 7 is a great watch and I\\x92m really enjoying it After years of using Pebble and Amazfit watches I decided to go Apple Watch because of the heart monitoring features and solid support for my iOS devices phone tablet The watch works great Getting it setup with my iPhone 12 Pro was just a nonevent It worked instantly\\n\\nThe display is amazing Just gorgeous The reaction time with using the screen crown or button is instant No lag at all\\n\\nThe only issue I have is the battery I never went to Apple Watch before Series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere I got is just untenable\\n\\nSeries 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours HA Im lucky to get 10 or 12 and it doesnt even do much during the day Ive tested others like several Android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery\\n\\nThe sleep tracking works fine but its not comfortable to wear in bed all night I dont think any band is\\n\\nOverall I like it Ill use it It works super well with my iPhone and the apps are great But honestly if I had known the battery life was this short with average usage I would have probably gone with another Amazfit or the Pebble based FitBit Versa 3 I love this watch  It is everything I expected There are so many options for different types of bands Its also great for keeping track of your overall health\\nI dont have to run to the other room to answer my phone I absolutely love that This watch is a must have if youre an Apple user Great apple packaging but it never came with a charging base only the chord So it couldnt be charged and used when first received Every feature of this watch is spot on Purchased for emergency SOS and for GPS location should I fall or otherwise need help I love the gold stainless case and the ability to have a cellular connectivity as well as pair with my iPhone I have had another apple watch aluminum case and liked it very much but wanted a gold stainless case thus the reason for buying this one Re SOS feature I fell recently and the watch was faster at responding than my fall alert button for which I pay a monthly fee\\nThe reason I gave the watch a 4 star review is because I thought I was purchasing a NEW watch but in fact when it came and I placed it on the charger it became very hot and I realized the battery must be bad So I investigated further and found out it was a refurbished watch good condition Am giving a 4 star review only because I am returning the watch due to battery heating up when on charge I will purchase another apple watch NEW this time The wife loves it she is the Apple fan in the family I was very excited to get this It is exactly as expected Good battery life comes with the charger and easy to set up Love my new watch Purchased a few different bands so I could change up the look too Wouldn\\x92t trade it for anything Great product Easy to program and look very cool Got it for Heart monitoring Works great It must pair with your iPhone confusing which is dominate on various apps Helpful to have an Apple store nearby or a teenager Can not use regular wrist bands apple unique Can\\x92t get any better YO BUY DIS WATCH Me gustó mucho el Apple Watch es el primero que tengo y no he tenido quejas súpero mis expectativas de batería y rendimiento  great sturdy watch\\n shipping was fast and the packaging was good\\n battery life could be better Can\\x92t really add much to what has been said but the Series 7 Watch hits all the right notes I wasn\\x92t sure if I\\x92d even like a smart watch but a friend that knows me well said I would and was more than correct\\n\\nI am pleased with the simplicity yet sophistication of the platform and how it seamlessly handles information It took me a couple of hours to get the basic functions down but I\\x92ve been pleased with the many personalizations available and wideranging features Fun versatile useful Recommend Everything works really well Able to track fitness goals along with operating everything from the watch instead of my iPhone all the time Easy to use and very versatile was surprised to have a compass option on the watch  awesome watch  does more than expected Loved it Like everything about it Battery life is great and enjoy using the activity part of watch This product did not disappoint It reminds me to stand every hour to increase my mobility I have been wearing my watch for a few weeks Still getting use to it I really like it I am glad I bought it\\nI use it every night for sleep It is cool\\nI did buy a different kind of stretch strap It s easier to wash and dry hands with the stretch strap not that bad  it is the best electric watch but need to charge every night Great watch This is a legit Apple product Love this watch I went from a series 3 to this series 7 I\\x92m mean WOW\\x85 what a difference 100 recommend Great look and healthy appo Upgraded from Series 3 \\x97 woah big upgrade\\nLove it looks really good Came in original Apple packaging with charger  band A Buy Heart rate and oxygen Had this watch for maybe three weeks now So far it works great I love the sleep tracking and the ecg apps I\\x92m a telemetry tech so I find it neat to see my own rhythm and not have to put on the hospitals box to see it \\nThe battery lasts roughly 24 hours depending how much I\\x92m on it which is a lot because I\\x92m still toying will all it has to offer Love that I can locate my phone with my watch and vice versa yes I lose my phone a lot in my own home I didn\\x92t realize I could actually take calls on the watch that was pretty cool the first time I answered and it was clear Love that instead of looking down at my phone while using gps it\\x92s right on my wrist where to turn Overall my switch from android in general has been pretty successful so far Just wished I didn\\x92t have to charge the watch every day while my phone lasts 23 sometimes 4 days I just charge it while I\\x92m folding laundry and it takes roughly an hour to reach 100 so I will take that fast charge any day A must have for all Apple enthusiasts Estaba dañado I upgraded from a series 3 I love all the new features Everything came how it was supposed to Pairing was so easy I was kinda scared because of some reviews but it didn\\x92t take long at all I love the Apple Watch  No longer do I have to carry my phone around with me My watch is all I need to texting answering calls  The watch itself is fine not much different from the 6 The faster battery charging is very misleading Yes if the watch is very low  it charges to 30 very fast But after that it is a snail I dont charge it at night because I want to use the sleep tracking feature I also got the 6 and now the 7 for the fall detector feature With my six i could put it on the charger while I ate a meal or took a shower and it was almost fully charged The 7 it spends more time on the charger than my wrist which kind of defeats the purpose of why I use the watch And lets not forget to mention that they6 changed the charger type  so you will probably have to get a new upgraded charger before you can use the watch If this save the battery feature is a programing thing please get rid of it or give the user the choice of which way they want to charge the battery I am very disappointed in the watch By far the best Apple Watch so far the features are amazing for such a good price Love the watch Was good deal and I like it Second Apple Watch for me Excellent watch Well worth every cent that you pay for it So to start pretty cool you can use it for texts calls and such but it sucks knowing your carrier doesn\\x92t support apple watches after years they have been around you\\x92d think all services support them another problem my watch had a few scuffs nothing major but was it used Didnt look used but nothing that would bother me so much Overall looks sleek the band is slightly dark navy blue but black pretty much midnight sky color id recommend the watch to anyone just make sure you\\x92re service provider is eligible for it It took a lot for me to switch from wearing my collectible Invicta watches but after purchasing and wearing while working walking working out and syncing with my iPhone for health logs\\x85I was sold I suggest if this is your desires or need to reconsider if you have doubts i did and very happy with my decision Just ok should of gone with the SE Watch is nice like others Went with the 7 over the SE for the battery but don\\x92t notice any difference for the extra money Exelent Apple usually does quick but the ml band to big Sm comes off in my sleep Fue el regalo de cumpleaños Pat mi hija y ella amo su reloj After 7 iterations I finally got my first Apple Watch The reason why I held up so long was because of a simple question WHY DO I NEED AN APPLE WATCH\\n\\nFor the most part I am pretty simplistic and live by minimal means The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof durable and has great utility The AP7 does it all Im also getting older and I want to keep track of my health I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health\\n\\nThe AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture Im able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does in some form interrupt my productivity The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking To maximize my daytoday productivity I need the best quality of sleep So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep\\n\\nIt is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates\\n\\nHowever my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life It doesnt bother me so much but I have to charge it every night\\n\\nIt looks amazing has professional and luxury vibes and is pretty customizable There are nonOEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking\\n\\nOverall I am pretty happy with it Cheers Excellent product no doubt Didn\\x92t like the fact that it didn\\x92t come with a plug end for the charger I\\x92ve used the ECG app and 02 sat app and both work great Absolutely in love with this watch it does it all And looks stylish It\\x92s a great product to use all features of the Watch starting with counting steps tracking sleep and many more I like that it is bigger than my old Apple Watch Todo muy bien The battery lasts longer for me than expected I can go a day and a half without charging it Sleep tracking is not detailed but it is hard to beat the rest of the health features Works wonderfully Play Video\\n\\xa0Good watch definitely a good upgrade from my series 2 Go for it if you\\x92re considering it Haven\\x92t measured the life span of the battery but it seems to be making good time from its charge\\nThe green doesn\\x92t look very green if that makes sense it almost looks black in a certain light so don\\x92t be put off by it This is about my 7th smart watch Ive have a couple of Fitbits a Jawbone a Zenwatch 3 prettiest of the bunch a Samsung Galaxy and an Amazfit Bip good watch for the money Ive basically got a smart watch museum I got the Apple Watch because honestly Im getting older and I wanted the fall detection and health features Ive had it for a couple of weeks and heres what I think from bad to good\\n1 Battery life sucks Itll get through one day but thats it The Bip would last for 3 weeks on a charge\\n2 The screen isnt great in direct sun Its better than some others but doesnt hold a candle to the Bip which was somehow reflective in bright light sort of like a Kindle\\n3 The sleep tracking is ok about what youd expect from a movement detecter but the app for it isnt very good Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now\\n4 It has some very nice watch faces with custom complications Best of the bunch\\n5 Very comfortable to wear The big stem doesnt get in the way at all\\n6 The health features work great It accurately tracks you pulse and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection but battery is likely a problem\\n7 The fitness features rock Even without a subscription the watch has helped me get my exercise\\n\\nIt has a ton of other useful features Siri works fine you can control Spotify with it maps are kind of fun Lots of other things The really good thing is that as the practical king of smart watches there are 3rd party appsintegrations to do just about anything that could make sense and its unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were Pro\\x92s Got the 45  nice large face I\\x92m 6\\x924 and 215  easy set up just scan the face and follow prompts  I have the iPhone 11  heart app including ecg works great  why I bought it decent price Cons no wall wart for charger cable  strap is garbage I replaced with a snap flex metal look type I also bought a set of three screen protectors  made in China unfortunately As it stands now after a week unless they make a health watch with equal gizmos in the USA  I\\x92d buy it again If something changes and the watch boinks out  I\\x92ll change my review Oh and watch the price it seems to fluctuate every few days Now it\\x92s 371 I paid 379 and yesterday it was 419 And I did put the watch in a kinda sleep mode  come on with wrist movement or tap the screen and it surely helps battery life a lot Still needs charging at some point every day I especially need it at night I bought this to replace my Series 1 watch that finally gave up the ghost still worked but screen burned out As this is Series 7 I was expecting a lot Aside from an EKG and not very accurate blood oxygen monitoring this watch is not a vast improvement Battery life is just as bad And yeah it has a sleep monitor  but who can use it because battery is almost dead when I go to bed So it\\x92s kind of useless\\nI bought it to help keep track of workoutswalking And it does that just fine\\nSo  while I am a fan of this watch and wear it every day I think that Apple needs to spend more time improving performance and features Obsessed with my Apple Watch Perfect I love my watch I like being able to not have my bulky phone with me I live at the beach so it is convenient when walking the beach or at the pool I haven\\x92t learned to use all the features yet but so far I love it I love my watch it is easy to use Super value here Ive had an iwatch3 and decided to upgrade to a 7 This new watch is one of the most amazing electronic products Ive ever owned It took me 5 minutes to set up it used all my old watchs settings automatically I am very glad I purchased this even though on paper I was not sure the upgrade would be worth it The screen is great the phone works great and all of the health and exercise apps are phenomenal The battery goes down only 50 after the entire day I use my old magnetic charger and NOT the new high speed usbc charger that comes with the 7  and it still charges just fine at night very good thanks Very nice and love it I like everything about this series 7 watch My Apple Watch is working again so I\\x92m grateful for that However it definitely is not easy to maneuver and work with compared to the Fitbit I have to tell it that I\\x92m exercising and what exercise I\\x92m doing instead of just identifying like the Fitbit that I\\x92m exercising It\\x92s difficult to follow the sleep coveragedata However I am OK with it Not thrilled I don\\x92t like it as much as I like my Fitbit but now that it\\x92s working again I\\x92m OK with it Hence I\\x92m raising it from one star to three stars\\n\\nIt was challenging adapting to the Apple Watch after using the Fitbit for so long I definitely preferred the Fitbit in many ways But what pushed me over the line is two days after my return warranty the Apple Watch stopped working Two days Very frustrating and quite frankly disgusting and not OK I love this watch so light compared to my series 3 Apple watch I love the bigger face Highly recommended for those who already own apple equipment Perfect replacement for my lost Apple Watch 6 Perfect fit and color for myself Como reloj es genial liviano resistente al agua con muchas funcionalidades y atención de SIRI constante la batería podría ser de mayor duración ya que esta dura un día y medio pero en lo demás es una herramienta que vale la pena Incredible features Will take a while to learn all of the capabilities Great buy during Prime Days Perfect size for petite frame Love price Fast shipping Great investment for healthy lifestyle\\nNeeds charging daily but does so quickly\\nAppreciate having all my Apple devices synced I was so disappointed that it did not come with a charging chord I had many apple chargers but none worked I had to go buy a new charger For the price of the watch you think it would have come with a charger I love the functionality of my Apple Watch I have to charge the battery every night so the sleep tracking function is out I also had an allergic reaction to the metal post that holds the watch band closed It\\x92s supposed to be stainless steel but must contain some nickel I had to buy a different band Awesome product Heart and EKG Upgrading from a series 3 to 7 love the new look and screen size New functionally is fun as well Big fan of apple watch my day to day would be much more difficult without it Fantastic Great watch Very good Good buy Would not change it for the world wonderful watch Received with small scratch Love it Unfortunately I did not realize Starlight was beige Back it goes Very nice Watch nice upgrade from 41 mm watch I love the health apps  Oxygen heart rate EKG and the activity monitor and workout tracking are very motivating It\\x92s nice and convenient to have a phone timer music and podcasts on my wrist All in all am very happy I finally broke down and got it on sale I got the regular sport band  if you\\x92re interested in the braided solo loop I highly recommend getting fitted at an Apple Store or Best Buy Bought on prime days Great watch Na Had been meaning to get an apple watch for quite some time and I\\x92m super happy that I did I like that the watch came with two different band lengths so that you could figure out what works better for your wrist Set up was pretty easy as well Happy so far I love my watch\\x85Sleep tracking PulseOx and ECG are my favorites Great watch I use wear mine every day My watch lasts about a day and a half Not familiar with the sleep tracking or the most app I debated ordering this watch because I\\x92ve never paid so much for a watch Worth every penny I\\x92m happy that I treated myself I love totally it i LOVE this watch great purchase so happy with it Apple Watch arrived on time and work\\x92s great and was easy to set up and had no problems with it so far its elegant smart and fun I like it for tracking my sleep patterns I love the functionality of this watch Battery life has been less satisfying has to be charged daily even with settings adjusted to conserve battery life I can accommodate this so will keep using the watch Love all the apps that it has\\nBatter does last a lot longer than my three that I still have This keeps me off my phone while helping me look cool Would buy again This is my first Apple Watch and very pleased with the functionality of this Apple product When ordering through Amazon with Apple Care Plus check to make sure if the order details show a serial number that it matches the Apple Watch Mine not however Amazon rectified the issue Bastante bien todo funciona a la perfección Amazing watch Perfect This was my first smart watch and waited this long to make sure after many iterations of this watch it would have many sensors and be durable As for sensors it is great As for durability I got tricked into believing this hype of Gorilla glass blah blah and how it is stronger than previous gen etc My screen got scratched on the 2nd day of wearing it very deep I wish I bought screen protector on day 1 like I do with phones I thought on iteration 7 it should be somewhat scratch resistant nah do not believe the hype Love this watch Apple never fails me Like having a computer on my wrist Wife finally made the move from Fitbit to Apple Watch The issue she has is the battery life I love the apple features and experience Way more reliable and resistant to knocks than my Apple 5 Great battery life and charging speed Works perfectly only problem is that the box was damaged It was thrown into a box 5 times it\\x92s size unprotected it could have been damaged if it was mishandled Super great deal on Amazon Prime Day Saved a lot My wife is using the watch track her exercise activities The Apple Watch 7 is so much faster and more responsive than my Watch 3 it\\x92s shocking Like it\\x92s night and day Kinda cool that my Apple Watch is useful again Also the bigger screen is seriously way larger It\\x92s really helpful when glancing over an email or text Also visibly thinner than the Watch 3 EXCELENTE the carrier did not listen to the words put the damn thing at our back door next to our gate and put it infront of the house where everyone can see and take it but this watch is pretty nice i use it for walkie talkie quick text heart rate for my weed when i do alot it is good for if i have a seizure and i cant move after it i can walkie talkie my mom to come and help me fast and easy she has the series 5 i have this one but it was irritating to set up It took some time to understand how to use the watch versus the mobile app YouTube\\x91s were helpful\\nCouple of tweaks needed the sleep tracker is not entirely accurate There are times when I know I was awake and it shows that I was sleeping Sometimes it\\x92s hard to request a work out verbally using Siri If you don\\x92t have the exact wording the work out is not recognized\\nI love all of the Health tracking information I purchased this for the EKG option Its been a few months and Im not sure I will\\n\\nCompared to my Garmin watch which my husband has now This is not a good purchase\\nIt needs charged every day It takes about 30 minutes to charge which is not bad\\n\\nSleep tracking program is a joke My Garmin would give me details of my sleep modes\\n\\nWatch itself is more comfortable and quality is there The programing leaves a lot to be desired\\n\\nIf I hadnt given my Garmin to my husband the watch would have gone back at first i spent days trying to make it work couldnt get notifications the always on did not work after returning one then a whole day on the phone with apple support finally the last guy i talk to ask if i had tattoos on my wrist so i tested it on my daughter and it worked i moved my watch to my right arm hard to get use to but has worked ever since something in the ink blocks the signals so most features of the watch will not work as they should other then wrong arm now i love the watch would recommend getting the screen protectors when buying the watch they give a good wrap around protection My motivation to get an Apple watch came after a very poor support event from Fitbit Nearly everyone I know who has an iPhone has an Apple Watch I was the holdout largely because the battery needs charging daily Well I got over that problem by charging the watch while wearing it Im at a computer for many hours in the day so I loosen the Milanese Loop Band and slip the charging disk under the watch and continue my activity\\nIts got so many great features such as podcast pause start volume O2 level timers workout access walky talky and so much more Ive only had the watch for under a month and there is so much to learn about what it can do I am looking forward to find what else this little gem can do The Apple watch is an amazing device and it integrates flawlessly with my iPhone My main reason for getting it was to encourage exercise beyond my normal routine To that end it has been a great extension Not only does it encourage exercise but it tracks every movement and gently prods improvement With the cellular feature if I forget my phone at home the watch still enables me to remain in contact and reachable by my family With my Tmobile account it only adds 5 a month to have the extra security of cellular connection for the watch I bought this at my dr\\x92s suggestion to use the ECG function That works well I could easily send the readouts to my Dr What I didn\\x92t expect was for the watch to motivate me to move more I was already active but now I move even more I also like the fact it vibrates when my phone receives a text or call even if the phone is in another room It was so easy to sync with my iPhone I like my watch a lot Comfortable to wear and I hate things on my wrist but no problem The watch is very intuitive I really like the health apps and how the watch supports those programs Very user friendly and so far its been great Perfect another great product from Apple Play Video\\n\\xa0I\\x92m new to apple I recently changed from using android for over 10 years to an iPhone because I really liked the Apple Watch I can honestly say I love the Iwatch series 7 I can track not just my daily steps and calories burned but also monitor my heart rate blood oxigen and heart rhythm I\\x92m able to get all notifications that I want on my watch receive and answer calls and texts Plus I can personalize it to my needs abs style by changing the faces and bands The color is very nice Apple is slowly improving these things But they really need to work on battery life good Like every single thing in this tracking device Light weight Doesn\\x92t weigh my arm down Love the bands so comfy Worth the price Much better than a Fitbit Bought two Both people who wear them broke out on their wrist after only wearing them for a couple months One wears theirs all the time the other only wears it Monday to Friday at work inside Not sure why the rash but it itches and takes weeks to clear up and not wearing the watch My last Apple Watch never did this to my skin Poz here and want to support HIV research Really like this watch Love the activity app Got it for the health features but it has lots of thing that make it very handy Awesome It\\x92s a very and advanced watch I love it Excellent Just love it Great watch Love most everything about it No complaints except I wish I would have bought one earlier Faster charging alone makes it worth the money Super fast charging time Me agrada lo fácil que es su manejo y me mantiene en chequeo de mi caminatas o mi corazón Fast shipping great price The watch is amazing So far so good Does not keep up with my sleep battery life is ok but not great All the apps don\\x92t work like they did when I purchased it 4 months ago I do like being able to answer phone on it does a great job on\\nHeart rate It causes my I phone not to notify me of all my messages This watch is amazing Its sleek fancy and it works very well There is so much that can be done on this watch it is amazing Quite the upgrade from a Fitbit Highly recommend Ease of use I love the watch very much Play Video\\n\\xa0Loved my Series 3 but it was starting to get pretty slow This fixes ALL of that It\\x92s an Apple product not much to say Love the watch Great features and easy to set up and use But seriously though 300 for a watch and they don\\x92t include a charging block That\\x92s pretty lame Great watch I bought two one for me and my spouse Haven\\x92t had an Apple Watch in about 2 years Love how nice the new ones are Theres no secret as new smartwatches keep joining the battle its still Apple who keeps winning the race Workout tracking steps heart rate ECG blood oxigen unlocking your iPhone and Mac without Face ID or passcode Apple Pay notifications for all apps on your wrist etc Its a very cool gadget to have very useful and very functional\\n\\nTo me the only down side is still the battery There are other smartwatches that beat the Apple Watch big time on battery so it makes you wonder what does Apple need to create a watch with a battery that lasts as least a couple of days\\n\\nAside from the battery which to me only represents the hastle of putting the watch on the charger for about an hour The charging is super fast now theres nothing else to complain about I picked the aluminum red one with the standard silicone band and I absolutely love it Loving my new Apple Watch and beat all the prices out there Apple Watch I bought this watch as a gift for my son even though he hates watches I am very glad to say this watch does absolutely everything expected and he loves it where is it every day  night only takes it off to charge it She loves it being 11  its a big deal for her Received one with a defect but it was quickly replaced My wife loves everything about it Except for battery life of course which is somewhere around 15 days so forces you to charge it every night if you dont want them to turn off unexpectedly Therefore 4 stars Love the health apps Everything exceeded my expectations Excellent Very fast  as advertised Works great no regrets I love my watch It alerts me when I have a new text message while I\\x92m at work It\\x92s very comfortable to wear Apple Watch Series 7 has reinvigorated mine and my wifes fitness activity Its downright infectious We now try to out workout each other Plus both of our watches look great and the technology is amazing I tripped over a seam in the sidewalk yesterday and my watch wanted to call an ambulance I didnt need it but if I had the watch could have been a lifesaver Couldnt be more pleased with these watches I use my watch for rental property alerts while working or multitasking Love how much time it saves me from looking at my phone constantly  We waisted 2 hours in Verizon trying to set it up They could not do it They tried 4 different times They told me it was an issue with the esim card So we went next door to TMobil Now I spent 2 hours with TMobil and getting the same issue I am sending this crap watch back I wish they will give me my 4 hours back\\n\\nI ended up spending an additional hour at Sprint and after few software updates Sprint figured it how to make it work The watch now works just fine I purchased for gift and she said its nice But the face is large then my last one and battery life is better Oh and its waterproofsmile you just cant make this up\\nShe enjoy the watch from phone call to do not disturbedlocate her cellhome alarm system and you know the list goes on\\nI hope you find this info useful but what more can I say it is apple  I have to admit this watch has been encouraging me to exercise more and it is fun keeping track of my workouts and walks I like the ECG feature though I have no reason to believe I have a heart problem\\n\\nBut one bummer I already have a scratch on the face of the watch One of the Apple Watch Series 7 selling points was a more scratch resistant screen It seems now like just a marketing ploy And I wish the battery was as strong as other smart watches I find myself recharging before I go to bed so I can track my sleep and use the watch when I wake up and work out\\n\\nOverall Im satisfied with the watch especially since it was on sale As a longtime Apple Watch user I initially thought that the Series 7 was not worth upgrading to After all my trusty Series 4 had many of the same features delivering notifications silently on my wrist sleep tracking heart rate monitoring and an EKG partytrick ability that I rarely use but is cool to have I guess and was more than adequate enough for my use case However my Series 4s battery life was waning and I was itching to move on from a rose gold watch so when I saw that the price of this particular Series 7 variation dropped to 379 I knew I could afford to pull the trigger Compared to my Series 4 this watch has many iterative improvements including an alwayson display slightly larger screen and a blood oxygen sensor that when taken as a whole make me a happy customer The midnight color is definitely betterlooking in person as well If youre an existing Apple Watch user and have an older model then this is an upgrade worth considering If youre looking to get into the smartwatch world and have an iPhone then this could be a good starter smartwatch for you This is a incredible watch from the easy use of the appskeyboardcalculator numbers with my big clumsy finger to the phones mic and speaker while talking to someone I love the many phone faces that are provided as well as the options you are able to use from your photo albums and the ability to download faces I thought the 45mm was going to be like other large watches I use to wear that dug into the hand when pushing yourself up But the Apple Watch is one of the smoothest watch I have owned The Apple Watch will be my watch for everyday use for the foreseeable future at least until I win the lottery and can buy a Philippe Patek for my daily banging around watch I got this watch for myself as my FIRST ever Apple watch\\x85 I absolutely looove it\\x85 I don\\x92t know how I went this long without one and I don\\x92t think I could go without it now\\x85 it\\x92s so easy and convenient to have your phone on your wrist so to speak\\x85 honestly the only downside in my opinion is that for the price tag of the Watch they should have come up with a better wristband material than silicone\\x85 I think it makes it look cheap and not very comfortable when you start working up a sweat\\x85 luckily there are many options for replacing the bands though\\x85 but overall happy with my purchase  I like it I don\\x92t love it I don\\x92t use it to track my sleep because I have to charge it Battery lasts less than two days so I am in the habit of leaving it on its docking station to charge at night Also first and foremost it should be a good watch Half the time I look down to see what time it is and some app pops up I love my Apple Watch I thought the battery would last longer but other than that everything is great I like the watch very much At the current price it\\x92s a pretty good deal for Apple users\\nHowever I would prefer a single app that consolidates all the data in a single drill down type dashboard As it is it takes me a while to figure out which app\\x92s settings drives what data on the watch Such as resetting the stand goal Still looking for that\\x85\\nAlso would love to know more detail on how many exercise minutes in cardio or fat burning or REM vs restful sleep\\nStill it connects quicker to my Ring app than iPhone makes answering calls much simpler than trying to find the phone and has the essential stats anyone needs to track fitness\\n\\nJust think all the supporting apps are battery intensive and kinda confusing Bought it for work mainly It works great wear it every day battery definitely last all day Play Video\\n\\xa0My battery fantast Connect in my phone very easy tell me everything I need Every Works great and all but just missing case as it\\x92s written it will come with a case and sports band Bought this for my wife to replace her Fitbit versa 3 which is a great watch except that the screen fell out of its base Shes had prior Fitbit watches but thought the Apple watch would be a better upgrade big mistake Where as the Fitbit gets a week out of each charge the Apple barely gets 1 full day A lot of online complaints of battery life on this newest version with no help from Apple I was hesitant ordering an Apple Watch from Amazon since I always do it on the Applecom website  but went with Amazon because of a sale price and great reviews I upgraded from the series 5 to the series 7 and I love it Very happy with my purchase Me gusto Mini version of cell with mini apps Best to help keep track of your health and calorie counting Take advantage of the health apps This watch face is too small  doesnt show up well  one day late frome being postmarked the 23rd of August 23 20222 My husband was in er 2 xs and i could not take care of the return mailing  so I am sending back today and hope ubder the circumstances this will be ok Thanks Blossom Morris Great accessory if you own an apple phone Love my Apple Watch very comfortable on my wrist More like a phone then a fitness watch  daily wear if you have a small child it will fall off your wrist continuously every time you pick up your child band doesn\\x92t hold  Good applewach He came exactly as advertised The features are great Mobile Apps  price is great Definitely like the watch Great apps heart health and otherwise Not as masculine as the Samsung battery on Samsung lasts DAYS this Apple lasts all day but needs charging daily Easier to travel with the Samsung Just note that the Samsung is only somewhat compatible with the iPhone Used to be an android user but moved to iPhone several months ago Battery is only good for a day Love it Although I am not a fan of the band that was included It is too thick I have bought other more comfortable bands I have not had any trouble learning how to use it That is great for a senior lady like me Lol Love personalizing watch faces\\nBattery lasts about 2 days and there are numerous apps available Got it today and set up Definitely worth the money and wait to get it and it arrived a day earlier than estimated Highly Recommend My daughter loves it It has so many functions it will take me a little while to learn them all but super excited to have this watch The color is Beautiful The band that comes with it is not white but an off white beige Not gonna lie I was Skeptical about buying this Watch but now I need it abuse I use it with my iPhone and it\\x92s really handy and because of it I\\x92ve lose weight through it like see how many calories I\\x92ve burned through walking and keeps my on where I walking during my workouts and for about about a month since I got this I\\x92m happy to say I\\x92ve lost 20 pounds it\\x92s help me keep track of my progress no bullship I highly recommend it if you never had an Apple watch and the keyboard feature it kinda neat I have had my watch for a week now and cant really say anything bad about it The battery life is excellent on it it was very easy to pair with my phone not sure why others were having such a time doing that All the features work just as they would on your apple watch The only thing I keep forgetting is the feature of the ear pods when I answer a call everyone can hear your phone conversation if you answer with your watch with no pods in I recommend you get another band if you have any allergies to silicone that is the type of band that comes with the watch The more things you add to the watch the more space and battery life that the watch will eat up Enjoy it GOOD I upgraded from the 6 se I wanted the o2 and the ECG options that the se didn\\x92t offer  watch arrived exactly as expected in apple box with the charger watch works perfectly with no issues Connected to my iPhone 12 without flaw Battery life is the same as my se but the charger that came with the 7 is amazing it\\x92s a fast charger and I love it My watch can be completely dead and I put it on charge and it\\x92s fill in no time at all I have noticed it seems that the 7 has a few more exercises to choose from  overall I definitely would recommend It\\x92s a good looking watch and comes in handy for many things It will make you\\x92re life a lot easier But this watch has a bad battery life 18 hours max life Other brand watches with similar functions can last up to 36 hours\\n\\nAlso this watch is bit heavier to wear to sleep\\nIt\\x92s not a seamless watch for a sleep wear Love it Good watchtells time date weather etc Great features Easy to set up Love the exercise apps Never miss a phone call or text message because you can answer them with your watch So many options Highly recommend Play Video\\n\\xa0Excelente Me encanta It took six hours to set up\\n\\nI am a techy electronics engineer I have dozens of patents in electronics and have written thousands of lines of computer code in three different programming languages But this watch is quite a challenge\\n\\nWhen I tried to pair the watch to the phone the phone said I must update the phone to OS 1481 Yet I have always had automatic updates on in the phone menu\\n\\nSo I spent a halfhour updating to OS 1481\\n\\nI tried to pair the watch to the phone again and the phone said my OS must be updated But I had just updated it So I called apple support They directed me to update my OS to 151 Why was I previously directed to update to 1481 when that was obsolete Updating to 151 took an hour\\n\\nNext when I tried to pair the watch the message on the phone says that I need to charge the watch I examined the watch charge cable and it must plug into a USB C charger which is not included with the watch Do you have such a charger I didnt even know such chargers existed I have ten chargers including several made by apple and they all only accept the original USB plug called USB A\\n\\nI recall reading a few weeks ago that apple was no longer including chargers I thought thats ok we all have lots of chargers But nobody has USB C chargers they are very new\\n\\nSo I ordered a USB C charger\\n\\nThe charger arrived I started the pairing process But the phone stuck for 30 minutes during the pairing process so I called support They couldnt get it to work by the standard way which is to update the watch software so they opted to install without updating the watch software That worked with lots of hand holding and took about 45 minutes\\n\\nAll together I spent about six hours getting the phone to work\\n\\nHas apple lost their mind Absolutely love this Still learning how to use it Wasn\\x92t sure I wanted one When I saw all the features it had I replaced my Fitbit with a Series 7 Don\\x92t use for sleep tracking because I don\\x92t like wearing jewelry to bed I check my Blood Oxygen do an ECG and check my heart rate every morning Love it What made me buy this is a review from a purchaser that said it saved her life because of the heart monitor So far so good I love it I even purchased the model that said GPS only but I can talk and make calls on it adding cellular I think is a ploy for phone carriers to make more money You can just get the GPS only and still make and receive calls on your watch using your phone number NOT a phone number the phone company gives you that is separate from your phone and then charge you for it I bought it used but it still has warranty on it I enjoy all the features and comprehensive abilities of my Apple Watch but the short battery life means it\\x92s dead before the end of the day Battery life could be better but it is a well made watch and works well You must take the time to learn the applications Learn how to use the watch and phone together Remember \\x93Apple Help Line\\x94 they are very knowledgeable and will assist you The people complaining about the C charger have me rolling 1 It has nothing to do with how the watch functions and 2 If you can afford this watch you can surely afford a cheap charger\\nNow about the watch Amazing Its everything its advertised to be The Amazon price is by far less than anywhere I shopped I ordered the watch Friday evening and received it Saturday morning Definitely recommend Doesn\\x92t come with new charger for smaller plug in cord Wanted for a long time\\x85 price is great\\nPerfect I have only had the Apple Watch for 13 hours too soon to write a review Perhaps which is why I\\x92ll come back and update it at a later time but I just wanted to post my initial thoughts I saw so many reviews about the battery life and I hate to say it but they were all true I fully charged the watch prior to setting it up and using it at 6pm on 629 I went to bed at 10pm fully charged at 100 here it is 6am on 630 and it\\x92s already down to 80 At this rate I\\x92ll have to charge it again by the end of today My fit bit lasted nearly a week before needing a charge Apple do better\\nThe watch itself is very nice sleek design fairly easy to use lots of things you can do with it I\\x92m just getting started so I\\x92ll update the review in a few days But overall very disappointed in the battery life Took awhile to get used to how heavy it was on my wrist I love the way the watch fits my wrist and the way the band feels next too my skin I\\x92ve had it a few weeks and really haven\\x92t tried all the apps available Love it I bought this for the heart rate monitor for my heart condition other than not being a constant monitor its amazing Battery life can be drained a little faster than id like but with that new fastcharging thing apple does its not too much of a drag down It did NOT come with a block only the cord Watch paired nicely It was very easy to set up Unfortunately the watchband does not work well It falls off about every half hour to hour whether I\\x92m sitting or walking I usually do not have anything in my hand that could possibly pull at it I am not sure why it doesn\\x92t work well Also you have to buy a cordor correct plug to be able to charge it which is not optimal I guess I have to buy a new band as well Even though it has and support lots of useful features but one thing I dont understand\\n\\nWhen Garmin and Fitbit can come up with 5 to 12 days battery life why Apple can not This is the only thing which regrets every buyer after buying an expansive watch Starlight color is striking Really like the night breathing and ECG features Favorite faces are the Solar Graph which shows the suns position in the sky all during the day and night and Astronomy which shows the sunlight moving across the earth The sleep feature is not as good as the Fitbits and wish it was better This watch looks nice on the wrist The 41mm is large enough to read without being too large on a small wrist Sleeker better connected more efficiently charged faster more intuitively organized and managed than ever before The single greatest advance among my repertoire of uses is its connectivity with messaging\\x97I just dont miss messages anymore of course I can put them off or ignore them whenever thats best but even that is more easily handled And next is the music I can now store on it which is easily accomplished and saves me taking my phone to the gym where I was forever misplacing it And next is the improvement in ease and accuracy of the ECG recording of heart rhythm Im nearly 80 so knowing I am or am not in atrial fibrillation is important to me on occasion which does not come up for me everyday but when it does I want the watch to work to do its thing and now it does I am grateful I could go on and on but I wont If you have need and means buy it Really love the watch and use it every day especially in my profession I didnt understand everything about it at first but it is a perfect fit Best Play Video\\n\\xa0Good watch comfortable and easy configuration It\\x92s a good watch A few friends had these watches and I became intrigued I bought one and now it is a permanent part of my arm or so it seems My only complaint is I wish the battery life was longer but that is a very small minus It arrived the same day of purchase which was such a plus Good job Amazon I love my new watch Great price with employee discount Birthday gift for my wife she had a series 3 previously and loves her upgrade Two fer for dad wife gave series 3 to daughter and she loves it too WIN This watch is WILD looks so good and premiumit came brand new sealed loving it\\nso far I can\\x92t say nothing bad on it for what I\\x92ve been reading people saying battery it\\x92s not so good but we\\x92ll see I use it to ping my phone if I ever lose track of it and it\\x92s nice to use for music controls Very happy with my purchase so far This is my first piece of wearable tech I chose the Apple Watch because Im an iPhone user and have faith in Apple products due to their simplicity aesthetics cutting edge technology durability product support and overall value So far this watch has lived up to all my expectations\\n\\nIn terms of feature benefits my main interest are the heart health functions including the MindfulnessBreath app The fall detection also seems like good insurance it will automatically contact 911 in the event of a hard fall\\n\\nBeyond that the watch itself is beautiful as a watch and very convenient from a communication perspective\\n\\nAmazons pricing and delivery were great I am very satisfied Nothing like ordering a watch that doesn\\x92t work until you go buy a charger What is up with Apple I love the fitness tracker and the reminders to stand if I have been too sedentary The face is easy to read and the notifications are helpful Once I found the right watch face that didnt eat the battery I can go almost 2 days on a charge Glad I waited for the 7 series watch awesome features Battery life is great I am happy with my purchase Play Video Did not really want it Kids bought it for non tech savvy wife So cool setting it up that husband bought one as well So fun seeing my wife setting timers and taking wrist calls while gardening\\nI would strongly recommend getting the unit with cellular service It costs about 10 a month to add to your plan But allows to make and receive calls without phone but moves to phone pairing when close Why During workouts or a dirty or inconvenient work like painting or at a lap pool your phone can be secure and protected Legit Apple watch Thanks  Im no tech nerd but it literally took me 10 mins to set up I already have a USB C plug if you have the latest iPhone or iPad then you should already have this If you have the latest phone then it should already be updated but if you dont make sure to update your phone before you get the watch I had the series 3 which I dropped and cracked after 5 reliable years unfortunately it will cost me almost as much to fix so I decided to get a new one Other than a longer battery life and comes on without having to touch it I dont see much difference in the series 7 Very useful and resistant I got one for Christmas so I wanted to get my daughter one for her birthday She absolutely loves it like I do Love getting all of my alerts right on my wrist And I can respond to them Watch housing looks more black than green there is a slight tint of green under a bright flashlight hardly noticeable Because it looks more black the housing matches with other color watch bands Other watch housing color options blue red and rose gold  don\\x92t offer the same variety in band choice because of the color Delivered product fast and product was exactly what we wanted Love it I recommend and you should get one it tracks what I need it to and I got to pick my wallpaper and everything A lot of apps to help your lifestyles Battery lasts more than a day so no worries about not having a watch working by days end I especially like the health and exercise monitoring I resisted at first until my children wanted me to get one for the falling feature I live alone It senses if you fall and tries to make you move with vibrations and noise If you do not respond it calls an emergency number\\n\\nNow I use it for everything Even telling time Great price and fast delivery Had some issue with charging the watch but Amazon was kind enough to offer exchange Not sure why there was no protective plastic film like apple normally uses Looks like it was opened before and later resealed with stickers on the edges neatly Nothing is wrong with my watch that I received thus far but it would be nice to have some clarification on why mines was not fully sealed Also I didn\\x92t realize that Apple does not include the whole charger set for this watch I had to order one separately and it took two days through Amazon to arrive so if you plan on using this right away I would get the charger first I brought this one because Apple Watch series 3 died Like the bigger screen Wrist band did not fit my tiny wrists at all Battery life still sucks The older I get the more I rely on my Apple Watch to track all my health issues so when I go to the Doctor I have a good report of my body to present to him I can pull my activity counts average heartrate run an EKG and more It even tells him how much I am hydrating If I take a fall the watch detects and asks if it should call for help it tells me when I have been watching my televised story programs too long and need to stand up and move and also tracks how well I am sleeping The bigger screen on this model is also helpful to my failing eyes No special likes or dislikes I think it works as designed I need to know how to use the apps better but that is on me I guess I purchased the cellular watch because I may want to in the future use the cellular part I am not using that at the moment But what I want to find out is can I call my 911 people do it even if there\\x92s don\\x92t have a cellular plan can I still use the watch for emergency kind of like any phone will do Even if the phone is not hooked up to a service Great product Satisfies all my needs I have medical issues and I love all the apps and info it comes with to help with stuff like this Third Apple Watch The improvements are nice Keep masking better My wife loves it does everything she wants it to Initially I never wanted a Smart Watch Then my husband got one  I thought his was pretty cool SO I started looking at one similar to what he had a Fossil but was unable to find something I liked or could even tolerate Since I have and love my iPhone I decided to look into the Apple watched and found this one on Amazon Although the price was rather offputting my husband  I decided that with all of the health benefits the watch has I should go ahead  order it Well since getting the watch Ive worn it all day every day and I simply think the watch is AMAZING I can check my heart rate throughout the day something I need to do and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels since I am a Type One Diabetic and have the DexCom App on my iPhone it also shows on my watchhow cool The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour which is great since I work from home  sit at a computer for eight hoursday I love that I can makereceive phone calls from the watch too In the week that Ive had my watch Ive found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone And to think that I was soveryopposed to getting a Smart Watch Now I dont know how I ever got by without it I ordered this for my wife It came when it was supposed too I didnt read everything about the watch the charge base has a type C plug on it and did not come with a wall plug so I had to buy 1 Other than the plug it is a great product You can\\x92t go wrong with Apple Watch Only dislike is that the 7 series requires a different wall plug end I had to order it separately Cuando compre y vi comentarios negativos lo pensé dos veces para comprarlo pero me arriesgue y lo compre personalmente digo que me arriesgue porque soy de Ecuador y no tenia como devolver o hacer reclamos ya que no me encuentro en estados unidos pero me llego sellado original con numero de serie original de apple lo he utilizado y es muy bueno producto me gusto el color Lo unica duda es porque en los comentario negativos personas mencionaban que les había llegado abierto o incluso solo les habían llegado la caja vacía en lo personal me llego bien 1010 sin ninguna novedad Only had this watch for a couple days but I\\x92m amazed at how much it does I\\x92m not sure it measures sleep quality but that is the only thing it may not do and maybe it does that too and I haven\\x92t found it yet So far I love it and with the super fast charging speed with a 20 watt usb c charging is not an issue I bought this watch because of a need to\\nMonitor my heart and heart rate Also to have\\nQuicker access to other information I need\\nMy Dr also recommended I buy this watch with\\nIt\\x92s ECG capability It has performed so well\\nIn all areas and gives me a new piece of mind\\nIt is very comfortable also I do not swim with it or sleep with it Very happy The watch is amazing love everything about it I\\x92ve always been a smart watch user however being that I recently converted to Apple after finding that I enjoy their products and software I needed a new watch\\n\\nThis product is beautiful The screen is high resolution it\\x92s fast and you can seamlessly transfer between phone and watch The screen is small but it displays a lot more information at once than I really expected it to so using it isn\\x92t a headache\\n\\nI love the utility Everything you think a smart watch should do this watch CAN do From needing a calculator to switching your songs tracking your activity  workouts basing the calories burned on your heart rate I exercise a lot and appreciate the information smart watches can bring You can text call read emails make payments Etc\\n\\nThe only issue I have with the watch is an issue I have with apple products in general if you\\x92re like me and this is your first apple watch you\\x92re probably going to have to watch a tutorial or two in order to know how to turn it on and to know what this watch can really do for you Apple does offer \\x93helpful tips\\x94 but those tips aren\\x92t really comprehensive as to how to use your watch I probably still don\\x92t know all I can do with it which is cool but frustrating Like it The watch has all good features to help with staying in touch with your health habits and contacts Shipping from seller was slow but that the way life is now I love the watch but the short battery life makes it hard to go any time without a charger I guess that is just the way things are with these digital watches so you just have to be prepared For travel I bought a portable power bank so I can charge the watch when I am traveling Best watch you can ever buy I wanted to upgrade my Apple Watch that was 4 years old Awesome larger watch face Does everything the old one did with some extras Love it I recently purchased an Apple Watch series 7 to replace my series 4 I love my Apple Watch I love that I can make and receive calls and texts without having to have my phone with me I love having all my apps with me as well I got this on a deal and it works great A more prominent display feels good This has everything I need in a regular watch plus a lot of features This watch is fun to use I use it to track my exercise sleep heart breathing Its an excellent health monitor too Buy this watch and youll be impressed with the technology Gotta recommend it My wife had a 3 and I surprised her with a 7 She looooooves it However If you use Skribble Its not easily found But it IS in there just scroll down to the botton of your new text and click it I have the six Bought this for my wife Mine has caught a fib three times which I printed out ecg and sent to my cardiologist My wife likes the activity app mostly Prefer apple due to iPhones the watches sync well Can\\x92t go wrong with apples quality I bought this for my dad as a way to get a hold of me when he falls and needs help up So far it works Easy to use Works superbly with iphone Replaced a Series 2 with this Series 7 AppleWatch and I am blown away by the updates to the functionality of the current watch Such a fabulous product and was really impressed with the cost on Amazon I thought Id need to wait for a major holiday or the Series 8 to be released before there would be a discountnot at all The blue color is gorgeous and such a wonderful addition to the usual black space gray etc I am totally satisfied with the Series 7 AppleWatch I\\x92ve had it now for a couple months AND I LOVE IT It great absolutely perfect  Definitely recommend Thank you Open box issue had no effect on the product The watch arrived as expected with no imperfection or defects Updated with Apple iOS to the latest firmware and boom You have yourself a brand new series 7 Apple Watch and you saved some money I hope this helps Im sure this works very well I realized too late that the watch I want is the one with fall notification and more health information and facial recognition The problem is how to order the one I want For the wife and she loves it I finally got the watch and I like it for the most part I like the reminders to get up and move very so often I like the interface and functionality The only thing I am disappointed about is the battery life I expected it to last several days It barely lasts two days The charging cord supplied does NOT fit any charger I have I love everything apple Great watch Highly recommend it for all people apple It\\x92s a great little gadget and I bet I will get even more use out of it as I become more active I love the Astronomy watch face of the Earth I do wish the default wristband was better attached though I had to buy myself an after market band because the one it came with didn\\x92t attach very securely and there were times where I unclipped it from my wrist and it fell to the floor Luckily no damage But for  400 Watch you\\x92d think it would be more secure I\\x92m unable to review any part of the watch due to the fact that it doesn\\x92t come with a charger adapter which I think is a little ridiculous considering people spend hundreds of dollars to buy the watch that comes with everything but a way to charge it to test if we would like it or not and on top it off the fact that none of the older model charging stations work with them either I\\x92m just a little disappointed because I\\x92ve waited about a week and a half or so for this watch and I can\\x92t even wear it until I can buy the USB adapter for it So happy with my new watch  wish the battery would last a little longer but otherwise no complaints So my new watch says the set up instructions are on the watch but the battery needs to be charged Pull out the magnetic charging cable go to plug it in and what The cable end is not the standard USB plug that works with any charging block or even your computer No it is a type C connector Good luck finding a type C charger or port in any airport or hotel Quick trip to the store to lay out some cash buying a new charger cable with USB connection so I can set up my new watch Really Apple You can\\x92t make your stuff compatible with any existing charger in the world No you\\x92re special you charge extra to make your stuff work Ok good I was a lil hesitant because some reviews had mentioned they were missing stuff and sealed was open but that was not my case got everything brand new and box was sealed happy camper I bought this because of the fall detection function which seems to work ok When I am rough housing with my dog it will occasionally start rattling on my wrist and ask me if I have fallen So for that functionality it provides my wife some security which is a good thing\\n\\nAs a sports watch it is really maddening The swim function is difficult to stop when you are done swimming So much so that I swim an extra lap to make sure my splits in my regular routine are accurate Today I couldn\\x92t get the swim function to work at all It took me to bicycling and would not exit I just gave up and swam my laps I think it has to do with the watch getting wet Funny thing when you swim the watch gets wet I have a Garmin that is flawless in the pool  all of the time every time Guess I will have to take it to the pool just to get me laps right\\n\\nWhen I walk the dogs the gps function seems pretty accurate Or at least it is within the range of error of the Garmin Walking works pretty well but I don\\x92t keep track of splits so time keeping is not terribly important\\n\\nFor the principal reason to buy this watch it does the job For anything else I have used it for it ranges from an F to a C I love the watch battery life is great just put it on the charger every night I use it for exercising it ll record I do a lot of communicating thru my watch it\\x92s very convenient with my job I give it 5 star FOR SURE Had the series 3 for to long I\\x92m glad I upgraded Would like the battery to last longer I use the health app and heart rate app If your buying this for the blood 02 app  Don\\x92t it\\x92s never right And most times it won\\x92t even read  Can\\x92t figure out what to do with the sleep app as I use my watch a lotBy the time sweet dreams come around my watch is almost exhaustedand thereby needs to be charged  As expected Very good product Use it everyday Came oem beautiful Muy util para todo Bought this for my wife for mothers day she really likes it Battery life seems good most of the apps work great facetime doesnt work with it neither does snap chat Different color bands and watch covers are available at a very low price I purchased 7 differnt color bands and 10 different color watch covers Girlfriend love and enjoy it Great looking time piece but for the money the battery life is terrible didn\\x92t even get a full day no matter what settings I tried With cellular this thing beats every other watch Ive ever had Lightweight comfortable with just the standard band i purchased other traditional leather bands and went back to Apples basic band Options in using apps had changed how a watch can work for you I seldom use my phone as this watch does everything Couldnt ask for improvements but sure Apple will develop solutions I havent even thought of and upgrade my watch Real useful watch not just a timepiece I upgraded from a series 1 and love this I can actually see the screen better so the quality is great Seems durable but I would get a screen protector to avoid scratches I think the battery life has stayed pretty steady and Watch came brand new despite a few reviews saying some of theirs was used Everything came as described It updated quickly and easily Didn\\x92t take more than 20 minutes if your iPhone is already updated Highly satisfied None too pleased about a couple things Made in China and didn\\x92t come with a USBC charging block I happen to be temporarily staying near my parents\\x92 home in the middle of nowhere where I can\\x92t just drive down the road to pick one up which means I have to drive 30 miles and it\\x92s continually snowing here with bad roads or order one and wait When you\\x92re from Atlanta and have everything at your fingertips this sort of frustration should not be encountered particularly when dealing with Apple We Apple buyers have grown accustomed to the finer details and Apple cheaping out leaving us inconvenienced like this is extremely the wrong move by Apple For me it\\x92s not about the cost to go buy a 10 USBC block it\\x92s the inconvenience and hassle it poses me that I have to drive 30 miles one way in the stupid snow to do it Geeze Now my pretty new watch sits here dead I dont wear a watch I only wore Fitbit for exercise time But then I bought iPhone13 and wanted to join the rest of the world  so I got the 7 series watch And boy do I love it This thing reminds me of every spy movie and every old spacethemed cartoon I watched The charger makes this purchase worth it\\nAfter all the gimmicks that apple can sell you the charger is where it is at You can charge this thing very fast and hence you are basically able to wear it all the time it maybe takes 30 mins to charge it The EKG is okay it only gives you lead 2 from my testing It is somewhat accurate but the readout AI read EKG will always give you sinus rhythm O2 sats are accurate and everything else is similar to that of the previous model Love this watch Only two detractors kept it from getting all 5 stars One had to wait to change the watch for several days since it did not come with a usbc plug in Two was there were no directions on how to hook the band I have never had anything like the one that came with it and I put it on wrong and it kept falling off Thank heavens I have a young niece to explain how to use it Play Video\\n\\xa0Everything is good but battery I use this watch with cellular connection when walking biking camping\\nI changed the band to a larger more tactical looking band as i am used to a larger watch\\nI liked it so much we bought 2 for myself and my Girlfriend\\x85She loves hers as well\\nVery satisfied and would recommend it to anyone looking for a apple watch i havent quite learned all the features available on my Apple watch but Im learning a little more each day Im not too pleased with the battery life but I attach the watch to the charge each day and alls good Love my watch it is amazing I\\x92m very happy with this purchase It does have sleep tracking I charge my battery while getting ready for bed and usually it\\x92s charged and ready for another 24 hours of wear time within 30min of charging I am very happy with all the features this watch has to offer I am enjoying this watch so much It was very easy to pair with my phone When I am driving I don\\x92t have to try and find my phone in my purse I just look at my watch Because this is new to me I am sure I will find more fun things my watch can do Wish the batter would last a little longer Does have a quick charge but the charger doesn\\x92t even come with the product And of course there is yet another special plug to charge this that will not fit your apple phone charger so that\\x92s a bit frustrating But overall product really is great Use it every day I just became an Apple Watch iPhone owner The watch came super fast The keyboard is a little harder to type on compared to the galaxy classic 4 Overall great product The watch disconnects from my phone constantly Screen goes in and out Doesnt notify when I get text Play Video Just opened it today so I dont know anything about the sleep function yet And it will be a couple of days before I find out because when it arrived it was only 54 charged and it has progressively lost the charge and now Im down to 15 and just discovered I cant charge it I have to go out and purchase another charger instead of them making it a usual USB Ridiculous Expensive watch and Apple cant be cordial enough to make all of their items work together This Apple Watch usually last a day and half until it needs to be charged again But I absolutely love it You can do so much with it and it\\x92s definitely worth buying The watch itself is perfectly fine and works as expected Ordered the green since it\\x92s my favorite color and you really cannot tell the watch aluminum casing is green Unless under just the right light Wish I had seen in person before ordering Love this watch Very nice watch and does a lot of stuff I\\x92m still getting to know how it works however so far very good I had previously ordered this watch but the box came empty I decided to give it another go and success Yay It all came this time It is a beautiful watch with tons of health features I am looking forward to exploring more This is my very 1st apple watch and so I got the GPS version because I did not know if I would like it or not or really use it and now Im happy I ordered This\\nI find myself using this for everything now and almost never take my phone out of my pocket when I am out on the go I can read all my Facebook messages and my text messages form the watch although one thing I dont like is that when I get the message it pops up the message on the watch as soon as I get it so others can read it if you dont look right away and read or clear it from notifications think it may be a setting or something that could be fixed with an update but have not really looked at all the settings on the watch yet just used it as is after setting up I love that it always stays on the band does not slip around your armwrist the larger screen ECG function and so much more Its the greatest I had an Apple watch years ago and I thought I remembered the battery life being a lot better than this one Aside from that is fine Works with my other Apple devices as it should Buen producto buen vendedor I upgraded from a secondgeneration model to this one I dislike that you have to pay so much more to get one with the Milanese loop band and have to get a cellular model to get the dark color This basically does nothing more than the ones that are several hundred dollars but are about twice the price That is the negative On the positive side I like the alwayson display the EKG function and the larger display I look forward to a time when these become thinner and have longer battery life I would buy it again My son loves it and we added a subscription to our cell phone carrier He doesnt take his phone when he goes out and still able to text and make and receive calls Hes Happy with it After spending 800 for this thing I had to spend another 20 to get a USBC charger cube I must have 20 USBA cubes but this is not compatible Of all the zillion devices I have none need a USBC female charging outlet I understand why USBC is needed but not to include a charger cube\\n\\nWith the battery arriving DOA I had to charge it from my laptop which was not very convenient since my laptop USBC port is used for several other purposes\\n\\nThey must have saved 2 Oh  add it right to the bottom line\\n\\nThere are also no instructions included whatsoever\\n\\nWhat a bad first impression\\n\\nSetup took over two hours with required updates downloads authorizations pairings logins etc I suppose a lengthy setup is understandable  but did I mention no charger and no instructions Im not likely to get over that Really  how cheap can you get Apple\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that I got a 31 page printed manual along with my Apple branded USBC charger cube I had to order but absolutely nothing along with my watch\\n\\nHow cheap can you get Apple How cheap can you get\\n\\nIts an amazing device but products that dont present themselves well when opening the box are doomed to failure in the market I am both upset with and shocked at Apple for this\\n\\n3 stars is all you get All the incredible engineering that went into this was lost on me immediately by the decisions made by some idiot productmarketing manager\\n\\nI am soooo done with Apple products Ok yes it\\x92s a nice watch but it Scratches very easily I think it\\x92s very overpriced for what your getting also battery last all day but cheaper watches last multiple days apple can do better it\\x92s a good watch tho Overall the watch is pretty useful it took about an hour to charge up and after that the set up was seamless and fast Llegó todo Perfecto la caja estaba un poco sucia pero lo de adentro es lo que importa  Coming from a Series 3 this was a huge improvement I\\x92d honestly recommend anyone debating on spending the extra money to get this over the \\x93still in production for some reason\\x94 3rd gen Apple Watch With the extra screen real estate it\\x92s much you actually get a full keyboard and won\\x92t strain your eyes trying to read notifications on it I love this new IWatch 7 this is my third IWatch Only disappointment is that the charger cable does not come with a way to plug it into AC You have to buy the AC adapter for the cable or plug it into your IMac The first two came with the AC adapter I would rather charge the watch this way in my charging station I know it is just another way for Apple to save some money but come on lets not get too cheap I really like the new Apple Watch 7 series The screen though only 1 mm bigger seems much larger and clearer I have not yet tried the sleep tracking function as the one time I slept with the watch on the protective case I bought for it cracked see my other review on that The watch offers several notable upgrades from the 5 series and the clarity and readability of the screen alone are worth it when it is time to upgrade or your old watch gives out Still figuring out how to use it I bought it for the exercise apps to track my steps and count calories as I move I expected longer battery life I use this watch for daily monitoring of my blood pressure and as an alert in the case that I would lose my balance and fall It also is capable of answering phone calls when I don\\x92t have my phone close at hand Great I loved it But the bracelet is not secure it has already fallen off my wrist twice\\x85 Nice product just Apple is too cheap to put an adapter in package to charge the watch\\x85 additional purchase required  I love it  i have a garmin fenix 6x pro and this watch  i use my garmin for more advanced sport activities while my apple watch is my daily watch  i wish apple spends more time to make the battery life longer  but as it is now it is acceptable and nothing more  the watch is comfy and light to wear Wonderful display and really helps me on my journey to lose weight while tracking all my activities I really like the Apple Watch Series 7 45mm size It\\x92s not too big at all Upgraded from Series 4 40mm and I couldn\\x92t justify going to the 41mm size Had to get it when Amazon had it for 50 off regular price So happy I got the Midnight color I use the sleep feature as well as the Blood oxygen function and ECG Using the Health App is easy and tracks many important activities Absolutely No regrets with this purchase Highly recommend Thank you Amazon I\\x92ve used this watch since 2020 or a version of it and twice no make that three times it is detected a fib which now I know I have due to the watch being able to detect this thing is literally a lifesaver  I received the watch I ordered but I didn\\x92t realize the charging cord was a usbc Why would it be that I also didn\\x92t realize that the bands included would not fit my wrist size On the longest notch it is too small So i had to buy a 25 dollar usbc outlet and a 35 dollar extra large 89 inch band Kinda disappointed I have used several smart watches from different brands and this was the most expensive one but didn\\x92t bring me any surprise The response speed was slow sometimes and it failed to test blood oxygen quite frequently And it was out of battery when being delivered It took more than an hour to be able to turn on the device not 15 mins as described on Amazon page Not worth the money Considering if I should return it Beautiful watch I have gone through I can\\x92t even tell you how many fitbits in the past few years I had taken good care of them too but technical errors got the best of it I thought I\\x92d give apple a try and I\\x92m so happy I did I love being able to get notifications on my watch and reply to texts Definitely something to get used to but I wouldn\\x92t go back to Fitbit after this purchase It was too small for my wrist to had to return it and get the 45mm The feature that i find most useful is the tracking of calories burnt It is connected to iphone and all the messages and notifications can be seen and replied to on the phone The blue dial and strap looks so good A must have gadget if you have iphone Replaces Fitbit much better Excelente producto la baja sellada y en perfectas condiciones I have 3 Apple Watches each a different Series  love them all I don\\x92t use it for things like sleep tracking but since I\\x92ve owned them I don\\x92t wear any other watches Upgraded from the 3 and I am so glad I did I bought it to track water aerobics steps Love the heart and oxygen monitor and phone Magnetic band has fall off my wrist 3x Thank goodness I had a protector on the face Now I have to buy another band such a waste of money I\\x92ve seen others state this issue as well Bought this after using a Fitbit Charge 4 for a couple months Upgraded to this and I cant go back If youre in the Apple ecosystem and need some simple health monitoring I absolutely recommend this I do miss the battery life of the simpler Fitbit though I love it  Very easy to set up Can view everything with ease Received in a couple days I like everything about it Big jump from series 1 to this Much bigger face I could text without my glasses if I had too\\nMost important for the price70 less than Apple I was concerned it was gonna come renewed even thought it didnt indicate it Based on the packaging it definitely came new\\nI would buy it again via Amazon I really wanted an apple watch i did my homework It was exactly what i thought i was getting My only negative is the battery life i would love to take advantage of the sleep settings but it does need to be charged everyday But im okay with charging it at night There is a definite learning curve If you get one I recommend loading one app at a time so you know what is going on Somehow I loaded everything that was available because it was on my phone and I do not know why the watch is doing half of the things it does I just upgraded from a S3 and to be honest I have a hard time finding the improvements The screen because of the rolled edges and the way text kind of rolls off the side looks strange and gives the impression your using a 3rd party app that wasn\\x92t designed for your system But you\\x92re not it\\x92s Apple The ECG system is honestly the only reason I bought the watch and love that feature If you don\\x92t need the ECG stay with the SE or S6 as that one does not utilize the rolled edges It is what it is u spend the money u get a good item Cool looking device wishe they should support what\\x92s WhatsApp I have always rocked Fitbit and now I\\x92m hooked to Apple plus I think it does a better job of tracking ateps I absolutely love my watch The screen display is perfection and the band is beautiful It does not come with a power brick however that has been the case for awhile now and I guess people just haven\\x92t read the description Having multiple apple products I already understood that this would be the case Battery lasts much longer than my previous 3 and I cannot get over how beautiful the screen is now Follow me simplysena for finds The straps are fire the quality is good worth the money I walk all day and rejoice  Love my new clock I\\x92m upgrading from a series 1 so it is a completely different watch I am very satisfied with this purchase Most of the heart monitoring functions only work with people older than 22 which is frustrating for me especially since I paid for the watch so I should get access to all the features Nonetheless I really like the starlight Apple Watch and band It\\x92s very subtle and nice to look at Hopefully braided solo loops get a sale soon bc I really would like one It is a pain that they dont give power bricks but this is the new age I highly suggest you purchase many usb c power bricks and switch all cords from usb a to usb c Anker has great ones and you can always find deals for them Everything works great with this watch it\\x92s accurate I use it it\\x92s motivating me to exercise more It turned out to be the perfect gift for her One would think that Apple of all chargeable watches on the market would stay charged for at least 56 days My old Fitbit was good for a week without charging That is the only knock I have on this watch otherwise it is beyond expectations If you want Save money buy it I love having the security the Apple Watch with GPS and cellular which is very inexpensive to hav my This watch makes it easy to call for help Hopefully if you fall you remain conscious enough to make the call as series 7 makes emergency calls very easy I would definitely recommend an Apple Watch with GPS and cellular for anyone The watch is very comfortable to wear I haven\\x92t worn a watch since I was a teenager The fitness reminders and features have really helped me to focus on keeping fit Love the ease of use with iPhone and air pods Love this watch Usually can get 2 days on a full charge even glancing at it about 150 times a day Also charges super fast with a macbook 30w adapter Probably would be faster on the bigger adapters but I didnt want to burn the watch battery awesome watch I\\x92ve always had the aluminum version but thought I\\x92d give the stainless a try and love it and it goes with anything clothes wise Love the always on large display swipe text works great Beautiful images on screen\\nBattery doesn\\x92t last as long as my 3 but I charge every night anyway Can\\x92t judge sleep function because it\\x92s on charger every night FANTASTIC PRICE Ok Great addition to the iPhone I came from a series 3 and it is a huge jump The battery life could be better with always on display but you can disable it This froze up at 210 it is currently 501 it won\\x92t do anything this is the second time this happened it is getting aggravating I love this watch Does everything I want it to do but I do wish the battery life was better You will get about a day and a half out of itpossibly 2 days I will say it charges very fast only about an hour so that is a positive Really like the slightly bigger size Play Video\\n\\xa0Es el original q vende apple Ahora viene sin el cubo Y la entrada es tipo C\\nVIENE SELLADO NUEVO NO DUDES EN PEDIRLO Bought this for my birthday I had boughten a 30 dollar fitness watch that I had for over a year It didn\\x92t track my steps nearly as good as the Apple Watch did This Apple Watch is amazing It\\x92s easy to read Links up to my phone super easy I am very glad with this purchase Love this watch It is the only one I wear even though I have many others The functions and apps are spot on Really like the always on screen Sometimes Siri gets to talk to me even though one does not have to say Hey Siri Sometimes this is a tiny bit intrusive All in all Im totally impressed and think this is well worth the price I debated Apple watches for a long time but enjoyed the features of my various models of Fitbit that I wore for a decade When Fitbit recalled my latest model because of explosion fears I made the switch to Apple Its easy to use and the integration with my phone is outstanding I just wish the battery lasted more than one day After contacting the chat feature for support I was told to reset the watch to improve the battery performance It did not I am charging it twice per day I really like it otherwise If someone can help me please let me know my boyfriend loves this apple watch it\\x92s the best apple watch it works perfectly fine and no problems what so ever i recommend this for anyone and it came early Excelente cumplió todas las expectativas Y llego súper rapido I almost had the same issue with Verizon not supporting this watch The Verizon store told me it was not compatible and that it was defective Amazon gave me the runaround as well as Apple I logged into the Apple Watch app and was able to activate it there on Verizon Only thing I really dislike is having to charge every day Will have to work into routine such as charging when having morning coffee  or shower time It doesn\\x92t take too long to charge thankfully Im sure everyone agrees but I also love the Apple Watch 7 Especially when playing golf it is very convenient to use as a distance meter I highly recommend it to those who want to buy it My Apple Watch will not work with my cellular phone they told me I I need a LTE Apple Watch phone it is not comparableto my phone please dyne the correct Apple Watch I had an older one almost 5 years old and so I knew I would love it With this one I got a bigger screen Totally worth it \\nEverything about the new one is great\\nIf you are thinking about one Trust me it\\x92s worth it\\nI use it for the workout features and keeping me from sitting too much Also to set timers and reminders Leave your phone in the other room No problem Text from your watch Talk on the phone too It\\x92s like an 70s kid is now in the Jetson\\x92s  Like a lot of Apple products this product is also exclusive in the hacked watch market Lots of companies that offer watches albeit at better prices but without a good price which is not the case This watch is a bit expensive but very affordable for those who have an iPhone It just completes the little holes that the iPhone does not cover for us For those who have a pacemaker it is recommended to consult a doctor It was a 41 mm and I wanted bigger I accidentally hit my watch a few times against the wall on the corners and really thought I broke it but nothing On this model at least you need a charging brick with a female USBC connection which we dont have in the house Now I need to go buy one before the watch runs out of juice Apples claim is that theyre reducing waste but it would reduce waste even more if they didnt ship the watch in a box the size of my forearm This is a copout Theyre just trying to save a dime\\nOtherwise no complaints so far Setup was pretty easy no issues with pairing or adding apps Tested out the Ekg function O2 sensor compass phone finder etc Functionality is good pretty cool features Looking forward to taking it for trail runs once I can get it charged This thing stays charged for a matter of hours Terrible It was a bday gift for my bfriend and he loves that A I turned off the alwayson as I could barely make it through the day Now I use around 50 for 24 hours\\n\\nWish I would have spent the extra 100 and gotten the sim enabled Fast set up had to upgrade my phone but that was no problem Took about 40 minutes bought the USB C charger after reading the reviews but luckily my iMac at work had the connection so I charged it on that until I received the charger With Verizon I connected the cellular in about 10 minutes through the app 30 activation fee and 10 a month The watch is in great condition I also ordered a case to keep it protected I\\x92m really happy with my order I also Afterpay\\x92d this and I\\x92m onto my 2nd payment 5 star experience fast shipping and battery life last long when you turn off the \\x93always on\\x94 option I upgraded from a series 3 and so far I\\x92m really happy with my purchase I got one for myself and liked it so much I had to buy one for my friend too\\nShipped on time\\nLove it I was worried it might be too big Its perfect\\nI have a small wrist and the 45mm was the perfect size for me My wrist measures 65 inches So what\\x92s the point in paying all of this money for a watch that doesn\\x92t even last a full 8 hour work shift for me I\\x92ve turned off the \\x93always on display\\x94 and even set it so it doesn\\x92t turn on without me touching it My watch dies around 8 hours I charge it every night It only lasted 7 hours yesterday and last week it only lasted 5\\nI feel like it was a waste of money So far I like the watchnot real crazy on the watch bandwill see what hot humid weather doesdon\\x92t think it will breath real well Awesome product from Apple First time to have an Apple watch love it\\n\\nUsing this to keep track of my physical\\nactivities My first Apple Watch didn\\x92t disappoint  all So I bought a new one and loving it I highly recommend buying 45mm It does everything I need it to'"

       "[\"I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch. I am a former die-hard Fitbit user and I never, ever wanted an Apple Watch. My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price. Sure it had annoying quirks and short-comings, but it counted my steps, told me my heart rate every min of every day, and it tracked my sleep. Well, when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty.\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window. I HATED it. 1.5 days of battery life? Gross! And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face?!!? I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face. You know what? It doesn't work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long, collecting your info and doing who knows what with it?! You know what else? You are still getting steps in even if you can't see the count 24/7. Who knew?! I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving! My next battle came with my workouts. The first few days everything worked great (although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts). The total vs. active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed. After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts. I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering. I looked online and could find nothing about this issue, so I ended up calling Apple. PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phone's date settings to get more lives...DON'T. Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity. Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness. We did a hard reset and it all worked again. I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage. Apple should be ashamed. Fitbit blows them out of the water there, but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins. My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts? Nope! I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting and/or double counting my step and exercise calorie burn. I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active (not total) calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness. That being said, I've been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs. for well over a year, and now I know why. After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts I've dropped 1.5 lbs. I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals! And from there, my love for my Apple Watch bloomed.\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it. The sleep metrics are so bad that I really don't mind charging it while I sleep. The workout stats are great and I like that I don't have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running. I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch. I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit (don't judge). I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head. And most of all, I have learned to love the activity rings. I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day (tethered to my desk). More importantly, all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count!\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone, I want to be AWAY from my phone. I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality. If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user, I recommend you give it a go.\",\n",
       " 'I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct. The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles, but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you\\x92re the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something.',\n",
       " 'My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn\\'t make that one anymore. And it was getting flaky. So it was time for a new watch!\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don\\'t like a large clunky watch. This one is perfectly sized for me. I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work. Then setup of the watch also took quite a while. After setting it up, I wasn\\'t that impressed. Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch. That only lasted a day or two. Now I just love this thing.\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it. It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the \"complications\" on it I liked. Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face. Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app... And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that. It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night. And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up. Overall I like the implementation of it.\\n\\nChasing the rings - Hey, this was cool. I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods. 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said \"Hey, it looks like you\\'re working out\" and asked me what I was doing. It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors. I responded and continued my walk in the woods. At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details. I\\'m a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome. I also closed my green ring for the day. I like it.\\n\\nIt\\'s an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch. So far I like it a lot.\\n\\nDurability - ? My last watch lasted 7 years. Will this one? I don\\'t know. Only time can tell that. So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other.',\n",
       " 'I love apple products. I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s. This watch is really great. If you are interested in making health changes, and workout changes to improve overall fitness/health, this watch is for you. I have had Fitbit since 2009. I have been a loyal customer. I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I love this watch. The health breakdown is incredible. It is so detailed. It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about. For example walking stability or walking asymmetry? Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry? It links to the health app in the iPhone. In there everything is broken down. It has pushed me to exercise more. I am a video gamer. This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score. If you game, you know how addicting that challenge can be. I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch, and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit. The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life. The battery life is pretty bad. I have to charge it every day. Do not let that impact your decision to buy this. Since that is the only flaw I have found with the watch I give this product 5 stars. Also, beware that this does not come with the plug adapter. It comes with the charging cord. I guess Apple no longer includes the plugs with their products, they only include the cord. I am very happy with this purchase. I have retired my Fitbit completely. I was pretty sedentary until I purchased this watch. If you love Apple and you want to change your health/workout patterns, get this watch. There are so many cool apps to get to track other things you might want to track. I got this on prime day, so the price was a lower. Overall, the money you spend on this is well worth it. I got the GPS+Cellular. You do have to take the watch to your mobile carrier to set up the cellular. It is swim proof and water aerobic proof. As usual, Apple prevails. I also like that this is a super user friendly device as are all Apple products that I have ever used. If you want to track sleep, there are multiple apps to track it, so do not let that deter you from buying this. Also, Apple has great customer service. They are available online or on the phone 24/7. I hope everyone who buys this enjoys this as much as I do. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Apple!',\n",

       "[\"I waited a few months to write this review because I needed time to accept and appreciate this watch. I am a former die-hard Fitbit user and I never, ever wanted an Apple Watch. My Fitbit did it all and for a third of the price. Sure it had annoying quirks and short-comings, but it counted my steps, told me my heart rate every min of every day, and it tracked my sleep. Well, when Fitbit got greedy and moved all of the cool new features under a subscription plan I tossed my Fitbit loyalty.\\n\\nThe first few days I had this watch I was ready to throw it out the window. I HATED it. 1.5 days of battery life? Gross! And how dare they not let me see my step count and my heart rate on my watch face?!!? I even went as far as downloading a third party app just so I could get my step count on my watch face. You know what? It doesn't work unless you want to keep a third party app up and running all day long, collecting your info and doing who knows what with it?! You know what else? You are still getting steps in even if you can't see the count 24/7. Who knew?! I no longer have a step count on my watch face and somehow I am surviving! My next battle came with my workouts. The first few days everything worked great (although I was SURE this thing was off because my calorie counts and step counts were WAY off from my Fitbit counts). The total vs. active calories threw me and I was sure I was getting short changed. After a few days my watch stopped counting calories during workouts. I could see everything working fine but calorie burn was not registering. I looked online and could find nothing about this issue, so I ended up calling Apple. PSA for anyone who plays games on their phone and toggles the phone's date settings to get more lives...DON'T. Apple forces you to keep your honesty and integrity. Toggling back and forth between dates messes with Apple Fitness. We did a hard reset and it all worked again. I have accepted that I only have 5 lives in Candy Crush and it is what it is.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch sleep stats are utter garbage. Apple should be ashamed. Fitbit blows them out of the water there, but that is probably the only area where Fitbit wins. My certainty about my Apple Watch short changing me with my step and calorie counts? Nope! I have finally accepted that Fitbit was probably counting my arm movements as steps and it was definitely overcounting and/or double counting my step and exercise calorie burn. I use MyFitnessPal to track my food and exercise and I was surprised that active (not total) calorie count is sent from Apple Fitness. That being said, I've been stuck trying to drop that last 10 lbs. for well over a year, and now I know why. After 1 month of my Apple Watch giving me realistic calorie and step counts I've dropped 1.5 lbs. I was overeating based on my Fitbit counts and daily calorie goals! And from there, my love for my Apple Watch bloomed.\\n\\nThe battery life is terrible but I have learned how far I can push it. The sleep metrics are so bad that I really don't mind charging it while I sleep. The workout stats are great and I like that I don't have to manually key anything into MyFitnessPal when I have both apps open and running. I love that my phone alarms and events will go off on my watch. I love that I can change my watch face to match my mood our outfit (don't judge). I love that I have Siri on my wrist at all times to take down reminders and notes as they pop into my head. And most of all, I have learned to love the activity rings. I did not realize how little I stand and move during a work day (tethered to my desk). More importantly, all I have to do is tap the rings and there is my beloved step count!\\n\\nThis thing is far more intuitive than a Fitbit. I am very pleased with my purchase. I did not go with the cellular version because when I step away from my phone, I want to be AWAY from my phone. I have had no issues with syncing or lack of functionality. If you are on the fence and you are already an iPhone user, I recommend you give it a go.\",\n",
       " 'I was a little skeptical about whether I\\x92d really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn\\x92t need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I\\x92m glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking\\x92s been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I\\x92ve seen have said the heart rate tracking\\x92s been the most accurate of lots of watches and I\\x92ve noticed that that\\x92s probably correct. The rowing app doesn\\x92t have many bells and whistles, but I\\x92ve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I\\x92ll do that since I\\x92m not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I\\x92m assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm\\x92s being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I\\x92m already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you\\x92re the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you\\x92re looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something.',\n",
       " 'My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn\\'t make that one anymore. And it was getting flaky. So it was time for a new watch!\\n\\nI went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don\\'t like a large clunky watch. This one is perfectly sized for me. I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn\\'t have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.\\n\\nSetup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work. Then setup of the watch also took quite a while. After setting it up, I wasn\\'t that impressed. Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch. That only lasted a day or two. Now I just love this thing.\\n\\nI definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it. It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the \"complications\" on it I liked. Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face. Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app... And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.\\n\\nI turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that. It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night. And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up. Overall I like the implementation of it.\\n\\nChasing the rings - Hey, this was cool. I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods. 10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said \"Hey, it looks like you\\'re working out\" and asked me what I was doing. It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors. I responded and continued my walk in the woods. At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details. I\\'m a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome. I also closed my green ring for the day. I like it.\\n\\nIt\\'s an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch. So far I like it a lot.\\n\\nDurability - ? My last watch lasted 7 years. Will this one? I don\\'t know. Only time can tell that. So at some point in the future I will update this review if I learn the answer one way or the other.',\n",
       " 'I love apple products. I have been using Apple since the first desktop came out in the late 90s. This watch is really great. If you are interested in making health changes, and workout changes to improve overall fitness/health, this watch is for you. I have had Fitbit since 2009. I have been a loyal customer. I decided to try the Apple watch since I am already on a Mac book Pro, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I love this watch. The health breakdown is incredible. It is so detailed. It gets every little thing recorded including things I had never thought about. For example walking stability or walking asymmetry? Who ever thinks about their walking stability or walking asymmetry? It links to the health app in the iPhone. In there everything is broken down. It has pushed me to exercise more. I am a video gamer. This watch makes me feel like I am playing a video game by trying to beat my last score. If you game, you know how addicting that challenge can be. I compared the Fitbit the Apple watch, and I think the Apple watch is far more accurate than Fitbit. The one thing about this watch that I do not like is the battery life.

       " 'I reserved buying an AppleWatch as I had always used FitBits and my main goal for a while was steps and weight loss. I still think if you want a pure pedometer fitbit is better, but not by too much. The computability with my iPhone makes it an amazing device were I wish I had gotten an Apple Watch a lot sooner. I most recently went with a fitbit sense and my wife has a Versa. We both had connectivity issues and always needed to have the fitbit app open to be able to sync to the phone. This applewatch is always synced which makes it smoother. Apps extend to the watch and the battery charges fast. I wear my watch all day and if I want to track sleep, charge it about an hour before bed and it lasts through the night and the entire next day.',\n",

I use this watch to workout and all sports. However I manage to get a couple of scratches on my watch by accidentally bumping into the wall. I recommend to get a screen cover for the watch if your scared of scraping your watch on surfaces or walls.\\n\\nBesides those 2 \\x93negatives\\x94, I believe this watch to be the one of if not the best watch for everything IF you have an iPhone.\\n\\nI bought the cellular one and it\\x92s very convenient to not need to worry about missed calls if I don\\x92t have my phone with me.\\n\\nI also use this watch for Apple Pay and it\\x92s super convenient!

This watch gives you a-lot of apps that allows you to work alongside your iPhone. It is fun to use and nice to look at. Although there are a lot of great things this watch provides I personally believe that there could of been a lot more incorporated in this generation of watch to make it better. The battery life is alright I\\x92d give it. A 4/10 it requires a lot of charging if you put it to use, which is understandable, just a bit frustrating. The big one is nice if you have a large arm, wrist, and fingers. The buttons are tiny so they have added a microphone, so you can talk into for it either for phone calls or voice chat to text instead of typing. If you have the money or want one I\\x92d say why not? The more popular they get the, better they be sooner, at least I\\x92d like to hope. As far as a future watch I\\x92d like to see it be thinner while being more comfortable with a better battery life.

I hand wash dishes everyday, never remember to take it off before I shower, and garden and do handy work. But I appreciate knowing how much I have walked and being reminded to stand up and take a break, getting messages the moment they are sent and not being chained to the phone.

I keep it on at night because I can\\x92t see my own clock with out my glasses and it has an automatic dimmer so it doesn\\x92t blare in my eyes. It keeps track of my steps which I find is way too low. I love answering it when you can\\x92t get to your phone in time and when I\\x92m at the grocery store no need to get your phone out at all. If people think I\\x92m talking to myself let them, it\\x92s all good. LOL Last night I used its flashlight and could not believe how bright it was.

The band has a nice soft feel to it and sometimes it doesn't feel like I am wearing a watch.\\nThe health apps do have some disclaimers so I don't read to much into it. For me I call it for entertaining purposes. My opinion is the results must me somewhere in the ballpark.\\nI have used the sleep app that came with the watch but only allows you to set an alarm. I already know I'm a poor sleeper I don't think I need an app to tell me that.\\nI ride my bike and there is a cool feature that detects that your riding a bike and records the miles,speed and calories.

It was delivered the day after I placed the order, the brick 2 days later. I also ordered the hard screen protector ( set of 2). I was able to set it up fairly easily, I have had it now for 3 days and have tried several of the features. So far, the one con is trying to respond to a text on the Watch. The keyboard is predictive and if you try to X out what you type, it\\x92s right under the Send. So my texts have been incomplete with typos. Fat finger syndrome! I changed the size of the text to help me see what I entered which helped a bit. I\\x92m left handed so the Watch is on my left wrist. Typing with the right hand is not the easiest for me, so will be working on improving my right handed typing or using the dictation more often. So far, am glad to have bit the bullet.

In fact, I have not worn any type of watch for decades. I must say, for me, I am extremely glad I went with the Apple 45mm. I have only had it a few days. One of the things that impresses me the most is it is not nearly as \"heavy\" as I had read. The Always On feature makes it so easy to quickly see the time and the curved design allows one to read the time at all angles. For the Face, I choose Photos in which you can choose up to 24 photos. The clarity of these is beyond expectation. Colors are true to reality; not dimmed; not fuzzy.; not distorted. Absolutely a treasure. As I have been a medical transcriptionist for 25-years (and counting), having the watch encourage me to Stand is a plus. Also, having the ability to run an EKG and check blood oxygen level are additional pluses. Would I get another Apple Watch? By all means, yes. Will I get different bands? Yes.

The battery was depleting very quickly due to all the apps and features. I had to decide which ones were important or useful for me, and turn off the rest.

I can understand not providing a regular USB block - I have multiple ways to charge USB, in fact many public facilities provide such access. USB-C is NOT widespread yet, so it\\'s an added expense to purchase one.

It\\x92s also helpful for pinging your phone if you can\\x92t remember where are you left it. The vibrating text message function is customizable so that you can be notified of texts from family members if you like. If the watch is synced to your Outlook messages or Calendar you will need to enter a four digit password to unlock the watch to even get a home screen.

It only charges from an Apple proprietary charger \\x96 \\x96 it charges quickly but the battery only lasts a day or two \\x96 \\x96 much shorter than the Fitbit life. The battery charging cords are not cheap. There is one included in the box. You are probably going to need to purchase a second one. The charging cord works best with a high amp USB adapter, which is also an expense. I used the atrial fibrillation app and it works well. You could also make the diagnosis by taking your own pulse.

       " \"I have been thinking about the Apple Watch for quite a while, had a colonoscopy a year ago and learned that my AFIB had returned. Long story short, I had a cardio version and was put on a beta blocker which worked well for about 6 days. Then my heart would kick back into AFIB for a little while, then the beta blocker would try to convert back to sinus rythym, in doing so, my heart would do what they call 'conversion pauses', only mine would pause to the point of nearly passing out. I happened to catch one of the worst pauses that lasted 8.7 seconds. I was using my Apple Watch in the ECG mode to check AFIB, at the time. My heart was pausing multiple times. Sent the recordings to my heart dr. and he took me off the beta blocker for now. I will go back on those after I get my pacemaker the end of the month. If it had not been for the watch and the ability to do the ECGs, I would have not known what was going on and would have thought it to be common under the circumstances. So, I think the watch may have saved my life, by helping to figure out the pauses, which kept getting worse. Thanks to Apple, I'm still here to write about it. Sure something else may have worked just as well, but this is what worked for me. It saved me having to wear a monitor for weeks at the very least.\",\n",

Overall, I think she likes it or she acts like she likes it.\\nCons: It AIN'T CHEAP. Battery life is short. She opened it to discover the power cord was missing which means that it had previously been opened. That was a hassle trying to figure out what to do. Talked to Amazon about it and they offered me $40 to go drive all over creation and find a way to charge it. The wrist band provided is quite literally, a joke. Order a cheap-o one piece when you order the watch. The problem is that it very easily pops open and the watch falls to the ground just like that, a dozen times a day and sometimes you don't realize it has come off. So that makes it super easy to lose. Really really stupid and poor design and they should be ashamed. Then......what we ordered was the Apple Series 7 (GPS) Brand new not reconditioned. What we got was the Apple Series 7 (GPS and Cellular) which is a much more expensive watch but we got it for the GPS only price. So again that confirms that the packaging was opened up and things were removed and switched OR it means that we got a reconditioned watch. THAT would really piss me off but I can't confirm it.

It\\'s unacceptable IMO for a smartwatch that retails over $400 (which the 45 does). If I ever get another Apple Watch, it will 100% be on the higher end casings that actually have sapphire glass. Friends have stainless steel and their watches are 100% scratch free after a year while my aluminum model is already scuffed and looks second hand after 2 months. In marketing and descriptions from Apple it reads like all models have the sapphire glass unless you read the fine print, this is just a PSA for those considering the aluminum.\\n\\nAs for the Apple Watch on its own merits, I love it. The sleep tracking is basically non-existent and the battery needs to be charged every day, but the other functions and the user experience are spectacular.

I never had an issue with it, but I\\x92d had it for almost 3 years and thought, if they\\x92re going to refund me what I paid 3 years ago, I might as well try an Apple Watch. All in all I spent less than $100 for the 45mm Series 7.\\n\\nFirst impressions: I hated it. It\\x92s got waaaaay more functionality than a Fitbit, and that\\x92s not necessarily a good thing. It\\x92s too much if you\\x92re looking for a step counter, sleep/heart rate/activity monitor. Fitbit uses ONE app to easily display all the pertinent info you need. Apple Watch uses no fewer than THREE different apps - Fitness, Watch and Health - to monitor info and/or change watch displays. You can also download more apps to monitor things such as sleep. It\\x92s not complicated, but it\\x92s overly complicated and cumbersome. Apple should seriously consider hiring some people away from Fitbit and take some advice. Oh, and the battery life is absolute trash compared to Fitbit. I have to charge it every 24-36 hours, depending on usage. The good thing is that it does charge super fast, but I guess it probably should, considering the capacity is so awful.\\n\\nIt\\x92s basically an iPhone shrunk down to wear on your wrist. It has some interesting functionality such as making/receiving calls, and you can send texts from it, although the screen and keyboard are so small, it\\x92s best to use the pre-canned responses rather than try to type out an actual message.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but I\\x92ll try to sum it up. If you\\x92re a long-time Fitbit user, keep using Fitbit unless you just want to try something new. But beware. Even after two weeks of the Apple Watch I was considering sending it back, but I\\x92m sticking it out. When it dies, I\\x92ll probably go back to Fitbit unless they\\x92re out of business or Apple makes some much needed changes to streamline it and improve the battery life.\\n\\nHighly overrated.',\n",

The reaction time with using the screen, crown, or button is instant. No lag at all.\\n\\nThe only issue I have is the battery. I never went to Apple Watch before Series 7 because 24 or less hours of battery life and having to carry a custom charging base everywhere I got is just untenable.\\n\\nSeries 7 docs state even with always on display the average is a goal of 18 hours.

I\\'ve tested others like several Android watches over the years too and none were this consumptive of battery.\\n\\nThe sleep tracking works fine, but it\\'s not comfortable to wear in bed all night. I don\\'t think any \"band\" is.\\n\\nOverall, I like it. I\\'ll use it. It works super well with my iPhone and the apps are great.

The reason I FINALLY got an Apple Watch was because I wanted something truly waterproof, durable, and has great utility. The AP7 does it all. I'm also getting older, and I want to keep track of my health. I want to have access to as many metrics to analyze my health.\\n\\nThe AP7 helps keep me focusing on the bigger picture. I'm able to handle my notifications without having the need to lift my phone which does, in some form, interrupt my productivity. The next biggest reason why I am happy with this particular variant is because of sleep tracking. To maximize my day-to-day productivity, I need the best quality of sleep. So apps like SleepWatch are a great tool to use to track sleep.\\n\\nIt is really easy to connect to my iPhone 13 Pro, and the whole setup process took about 15 minutes including updates.\\n\\nHowever, my biggest drawback for the AP7 is its battery life. It doesn't bother me so much, but I have to charge it every night.\\n\\nIt looks amazing, has professional and luxury vibes, and is pretty customizable. There are non-OEM bands on here that are relatively inexpensive and affordable especially for those on a budget to personalize the AP7 to their liking.\\n\\nOverall, I am pretty happy with it!

The sleep tracking is ok, about what you\\'d expect from a movement detecter, but the app for it isn\\'t very good. Stick with one of the gadgets that goes under your mattress for now.\\n4. It has some very nice watch faces, with custom complications. Best of the bunch.\\n5. Very comfortable to wear. The big stem doesn\\'t get in the way at all.\\n6. The health features work great. It accurately tracks you pulse, and will check you blood oxygen and ECG on demand. I wish it would do the blood oxygen periodically with low saturation detection, but battery is likely a problem.\\n7. The fitness features rock. Even without a subscription, the watch has helped me get my exercise.\\n\\nIt has a ton of other useful features. Siri works fine, you can control Spotify with it, maps are kind of fun.

The really good thing is that, as the practical king of smart watches, there are 3rd party apps/integrations to do just about anything that could make sense, and it\\'s unlikely the watch will be orphaned like my AndroidWear watches were.',\n",

Since I have (and love) my iPhone, I decided to look into the Apple watched, and found this one on Amazon. Although the price was rather off-putting, my husband & I decided that, with all of the health benefits the watch has, I should go ahead & order it. Well, since getting the watch. I've worn it all day, every day, and I simply think the watch is AMAZING! I can check my heart rate throughout the day (something I need to do), and keep an eye on my blood sugar levels (since I am a Type One Diabetic, and have the DexCom App on my iPhone, it also shows on my watch--how cool!). The watch encourages me to stand up a couple of times an hour, which is great, since I work from home & sit at a computer for eight hours/day. I love that I can make/receive phone calls from the watch, too. In the week that I've had my watch, I've found that I use my watch more than I use my iPhone.
